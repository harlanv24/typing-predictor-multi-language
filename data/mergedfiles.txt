The IBON Foundation is a non-profit research, education and information-development institution with programs in research, education and advocacy based in the Philippines. It provides socioeconomic research and analysis on people's issues to various sectors (primarily grassroots organizations). It aims to contribute to people's empowerment through education and advocacy support. The foundation is also engaged in international solidarity work.

History
1970s
The early 1970s were characterized by information control and civil-rights violations after the Marcos dictatorship declared martial law in the Philippines. Resistance to state attacks on people's rights intensified, and there was a need for information on socioeconomic issues.
The IBON Foundation was founded in 1978 by Sister Mary Soledad Perpiñan (editor and chief coordinator), Sally Bulatao (chief researcher and finance officer) and Antonio Tujan (former political detainee, graphic artist and circulation manager), six years after the declaration of martial law in the Philippines.
IBON published a fact sheet, IBON Facts and Figures, to provide readers with an overview of facts about important national and local issues. From an initial press run of 200 copies, popular response triggered the printing of an additional 2,000 copies of the first issue.
The first issue of IBON Facts and Figures was produced using a borrowed mimeograph machine. IBON first operated in a Religious of the Good Shepherd (RGS) Welcome House community on Zamora Street in Pandacan, Manila. Volunteers from the urban-poor community provided stick drawings, and economists and students were asked for written contributions or help with drafting issues. Organized sectors (such as trade unions) began requesting issue-specific fact sheets and industry primers. Public support ushered the institution into fully organizing and professionalizing its services.
From 1978 to 1980, IBON Facts and Figures became an 8-page thematic publication which was a data source for researchers, speakers, writers and seminar facilitators. Its research featured political-economic realities and the relationship between local and international socioeconomic issues.
By the 1980s, IBON Foundation  had become a non-governmental organization (NGO).

1980s
IBON established the IBON Databank in 1982 to provide socioeconomic data to researchers, policy-makers, educators, other NGOs and people's organizations. Ekonokomiks was launched in 1984 as a publication for the grassroots organization.
At this time, IBON went through a rocky period of regularizing its services and departments. After what it described as a lull in providing cutting-edge policy research “and advancing the public debate through a clear analysis on major issues such as agrarian reform, national industrialization and liberalization”, IBON reorganized and “embarked on a long-term research agenda towards research development on national industrialization.”

1990s
IBON devised a self-sufficiency program through cross-subsidies between revenue-generating services, subsidized services, maximization of resources, and institutional efficiency and professionalism. Self-evaluation and feedback from friends, clients and allies helped IBON reorganize its programs and services.
The Databank and Research Center was expanded, conducting in-depth research and advocacy studies, and aiming to improve the quality of its books and publications. Sectoral service desks for workers, peasants, women, indigenous people and the environment were also developed.
IBON began conducting quarterly surveys on a national-capital, regional and nationwide basis. From the Seminars Program the People's Education and Research Center (PERC) was organized in 1997. The Institute of Political Economy (IPE) was also established as an independent research and educational body, producing journals on theoretical research and introductory training courses on political economy.
IBON's Media Center evolved from media-support activities such as IBON Features, which presented social issues to the general public. IBON sa Himpapawid was a weekly, recorded radio program which also aimed to promote socioeconomic consciousness to a wider audience. IBON Video is a full-service production and post-production facility with a video library of IBON-produced educational videos and documentary films.
The IBON Partnership for Education Development (IPED) was also established. By 1998, the IPED expanded IBON's services to partner schools nationwide under the banner of Transformative Education (TE).
During this decade, the foundation also expanded its international networking and advocacy support and its services to Visayas and Mindanao with regional offices in Cebu City and Davao City.

2000s
IBON further developed its emphasis on people's issues and support for the capacity building of people's organizations in research, education, information and advocacy work.
The institution consolidated its advocacy and research orientations by ensuring that its research and publications would cover the urgent issues of the day and expanding its sustained information support and awareness raising. It also revitalized its capacity-building efforts by offering a wide range of advocacy-support services: seminars and training, information-network management and documentation for sectoral and regional people's organizations.
Popular education materials and training modules have been systematized. The IBON Birdtalk, a semiannual briefing on socioeconomic and political assessment and trends, was a regular event. The foundation also sponsors the Usapang IBON, a grassroots version of the Birdtalk which contributes to community and sector campaigns.
The IPED has more than 200 partner schools nationwide, and originated a TE-based critique of the 2002 Revised Basic Education Curriculum of the Philippine government. It provided lectures to teachers and administrators on the implementation of an integrative and context-based learning process. IPED was instrumental in establishing the Educators Forum for Development (EFD) for the development of cooperation and fellowship among educators toward relevant national education. It also organizes the annual National Educators' Conference and provides seminars to schools.
IBON also became an international publisher, networking with international outfits such as ZED Books and Global Outlook. Its catalog was broadened to make Philippine books available internationally and alternative international publications accessible locally.
During the first decade of the century, IBON International was established and expanded from providing services and contributing to building support to solidifying its role in establishing and sustaining international networks and campaigns. It also linked global initiatives to local campaigns and advocacy.
In 2006 the IBON Foundation moved from its Old Santa Mesa office to its own office building, the IBON Center in Quezon City. The building houses all the foundation's programs and services.

Programs and centers
The foundation is a multi-center, multi-program institution with research, education and information as its main focus.
The IBON Databank and Research Center is a core program which provides information and analysis on socioeconomic issues for advocacy issues, education, policy-making, development planning and implementation for non-government organizations, people's organizations, academic institutions, government agencies and individuals. Research is the core of its programs with the aim of disseminating the information in popular forms particularly (but not solely) for advocacy purposes.
The foundation's research agenda was developed to help provide alternative solutions to problems in production, livelihood and services at the community level. Included are industry and agrarian studies, research on transnational corporations and agribusinesses, comparative studies of economies, resource profiles of Philippine regions and studies on the impact of these socioeconomic conditions on social sectors.
There are also community-based people's action research initiatives on production, economic uplift and advocacy. IBON uses participatory methodology in research and attempts to democratize the research process through community-based people's action research.
The Databank and Research Center also manages the quarterly IBON Surveys, in which it gathers data on people's economic conditions and opinions about issues.IBON's People's Education Resource Center (PERC) (formerly the Seminars Program) provides comprehensive, informal education to grassroots sectors. It produces popular education materials and audio-visual aids on socioeconomic and other issues and training modules on skills training and leadership formation.
The IBON Partnership in Education for Development (IPED) is an alternative center for formal education which aims to promote transformative education through its partnership with schools. This includes teacher training, textbook development and supplementary educational materials at the elementary and secondary levels.
IBON International provides research, education and advocacy support to people's movements and grassroots empowerment abroad, linking these to international initiatives and networks.
To implement its centers and programs, IBON is organized into three administrative sections, seven departments and a printing press.

Just Kids is a memoir by Patti Smith, published on January 19, 2010, documenting her relationship with artist Robert Mapplethorpe."I didn't write it to be cathartic," she noted. "I wrote it because Robert asked me to… Our relationship was such that I knew what he would want and the quality of what he deserved. So that was my agenda for writing that book. I wrote it to fulfil my vow to him, which was on his deathbed. In finishing, I did feel that I'd fulfilled my promise."

Critical reception
Just Kids won the 2010 National Book Award for Nonfiction.
It was a Publishers Weekly’s Top 10 Best Books (2010), ALA Notable Book (2011), Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (Current Interest, 2010), New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2010), and National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (Autobiography/Memoir, 2010).

Lay Range in the Canadian Mountain EncyclopediaThe Santa Fe Island tortoise (Chelonoidis sp.), also known as the Santa Fe tortoise or Santa Fe giant tortoise, is an undescribed extinct taxon of giant tortoise endemic to Santa Fe Island in the Galápagos archipelago in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean. Evidence for the historic existence of the tortoise comes from 19th century anecdotes of whalers and settlers removing tortoises from the island, as well as the discovery of tortoise bones there by the 1905–1906 California Academy of Sciences expedition, with genetic examination of the bones indicating that they belonged to a unique taxon most closely related to Chelonoidis hoodensis, the Hood Island giant tortoise from Española Island (formerly known as Hood Island).

Ecological restoration
Following a decision made at an international workshop on giant tortoises in 2012, a program was initiated to reestablish a tortoise population on Santa Fe, after more than 150 years without one, using the Hood Island species as an ecological analogue, or substitute for the Santa Fe species. Between 2015 and 2021 the Santa Fe Tortoise Project successfully introduced some 700 juvenile and 31 subadult Hood Island tortoises to Santa Fe to complete the third phase of the ecological restoration program for the island.

The Wounded Deer  (El venado herido in Spanish) is an oil painting by Mexican artist  Frida Kahlo created in 1946. It is also known as The Little Deer. Through The Wounded Deer, Kahlo shares her enduring physical and emotional suffering with her audience, as she did throughout her creative oeuvre. This painting in particular was created towards the end of Kahlo's life, when her health was in decline. Kahlo combines pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols to express her wide spectrum of influences and beliefs.
Kahlo was injured at the age of 18 in a bus accident that resulted in serious injuries to her entire body. Her spine, ribs, pelvis, right leg, and abdomen were particularly damaged. She would deal with the wounds from this accident for the rest of her life. Kahlo painted this self-portrait after an operation on her spine, which would leave her bedridden for almost a year. During her recovery, she wore a steel corset, which can be seen in her late self-portraits. Her right leg would eventually be amputated up to her knee, as a result of gangrene.The variety of cultural influences reflect Kahlo's own background. She had a German father and a Mexican mother, thus she was aware of traditional European and Mexican ideas during her childhood. It is also known that Kahlo was interested in Eastern Religion during the later years of her life.In 1940, Kahlo married fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera for the second time. Their second marriage saw many of the same problems as their first, filled with jealousy, affairs, and arguments.Around the time she created The Wounded Deer, Kahlo made a drawing of a young deer in her diary, which is thought to be inspired by her pet deer, Granizo.The Wounded Deer was given by Kahlo to close friends Arcady and Lina Boytler as a wedding gift.

Description
In The Wounded Deer, Kahlo paints herself as an animal and human hybrid. She has the body of a deer along with antlers extending from her own head. The deer is standing up, its legs extended in action. Its front right leg is elevated off the ground, as though it is injured or in motion. In the deer's body are nine arrows, creating wounds from which blood flows. The deer is in a forest; nine trees are on the right of the deer, and a broken branch lies in the foreground. Only the tree trunks can be seen in the picture plane; none of the foliage above is visible. One of the branches on the tree in the right of the foreground is severed. It is probable that the detached limb is the branch located on the ground before the deer. The broken branch is prominent, as it is given more detail by the artist than all of the forest floor. Kahlo's face stares stoically at the viewer, showing little sign of pain. Her neck and head are upright and alert. A set of deer ears emerge from behind Kahlo's own. In the background a body of water is present, which can be seen through the trees. Though the sky is bright, a bolt of lightning strikes down from a white cloud. The word "carma" (karma) is written in the bottom left corner of the painting, after the artist's signature and the year of creation. The Wounded Deer is mostly rendered with green, brown, and gray tones, as well as small measures of blue and red. The painting's physical dimensions are very modest, measuring at only 22.4 x 30 centimeters.

Interpretation and analysis
In this painting, Kahlo shares her lifelong splanchnic pain with her audience. The pain she represents is not only physical, but emotional torment caused by her relationship with Rivera. Compared to the grand murals of other Mexican contemporaries, such as Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco, Kahlo's paintings were small. Some critics interpret the scale of her works as a sign of isolation, which also downplays her painful circumstances.It is Mexican tradition to place a broken branch on a grave. This is taken as an acknowledgement of the artist's deteriorating health. Despite the wounds on the body of the deer, Kahlo does not paint a face of anguish, but of strength.Scholars point out that the antlers on Kahlo's head are those of a stag, a male deer. Kahlo is representing herself as part male and part female, as well as elements of human and animal features. This hybrid form is often explained by the artist's influence of pre-Columbian ideas and traditions, which hold the belief that the right foot is represented by a deer. In this belief system, days were represented by a symbol and a number which preferably would be caused by the great number of the tree branches. Important dates such as birthdays which were used in predictions could also be used. Kahlo adopted the deer as a symbol for herself because of its connection to the right foot, and in the Aztec calendar, she was born on day nine. These two symbols together were not good, as nine was a symbol for earthly elements as well as the underworld, which was made up of nine phases. The number nine can be seen twice in The Wounded Deer: there are nine trees in the left side, before the clearing that reveals the ocean and lightning bolt, as well as nine arrows protruding from the body of the deer. An additional nine can be seen in the points of her antlers, if counted together.
In the painting, the deer's front right leg is raised off the ground, perhaps in a reflection of Kahlo's own impairment. At the time she painted The Wounded Deer, Kahlo had difficulty walking, which she would attempt to correct through a spinal surgery later that year.Some art historians believe that Kahlo's decision to portray herself with male and female features is a reflection of her own sexuality. This perception recognizes her bisexuality. Other interpretations of the figure relate the male and female elements, referred to as hermaphroditic, to pre-Columbian Aztec beliefs that hold relationships between animals and parts of the human body.
The meaning of the word "carma", painted in the lower left corner of the painting, is controversial. It was Kahlo's own belief that her life was planned out by destiny or fate, and therefore she could not prevent any of the difficulties she faced. Consequently, her misfortune must have been caused by deeds from her previous lives.
An influence of Christianity is also integrated through reference to the story of Saint Sebastian, a martyr who was tied to a tree and shot by arrows.The pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols combine to reflect Kahlo's multi-cultural reality –  a reality which also represents a spectrum of gender possibilities. She renders herself with these juxtaposing features to explore the concept of the self. Through these changes, identity is seen as dynamic and complex, not a fixed state.

Gustav Noske (9 July 1868 – 30 November 1946) was a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He served as the first Minister of Defence (Reichswehrminister) of the Weimar Republic between 1919 and 1920. Noske has been a controversial figure because although he was a member of the socialist movement, he used army and paramilitary forces to bloodily suppress the socialist/communist uprisings of 1919.

Early life
Noske was born on 9 July 1868 in Brandenburg an der Havel, Prussia. He was the son of the weaver Karl Noske (born 1838) and the manual labourer Emma Noske (née Herwig, born 1843). From 1874 to 1882 he went to primary and secondary school (Volks- and Bürgerschule). In 1882 to 1886 he was apprenticed as a basket maker at the Reichsteinische Kinderwagenfabrik and travelled to Halle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Liegnitz as a journeyman. In 1884, Noske joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and he also became a union member. In 1892, Noske was elected chairman of the Brandenburg SPD.He married Martha Thiel (1872-1949) at Brandenburg in 1891. They had one son and two daughters.From 1897 to 1902 Noske was politically active at the local level and worked as an editor at social democratic newspapers in Brandenburg and Königsberg (Volkstribüne). From 1902 to 1918 he was chief editor at the paper Volksstimme in Chemnitz. In the 1907 German federal election, Noske was elected to the Reichstag of the German Empire for the SPD where he remained through 1918 as representative of the Chemnitz Reichstag constituency.Within the SPD he was an expert on military, navy and colonial issues. After 1912, Noske was Koreferent of the Reichstag for the Navy budget. In 1914, he published a book Kolonialpolitik und Sozialdemokratie in which he argued in favour of German colonialism. He was known as a reformist, one of those in the SPD who wanted to achieve their political goals within the existing system, and as someone who was not much interested in fundamental theoretical debates.

First World War
During the First World War, Noske was part of the centre of the SPD, which also included Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann, and supported the war as a defensive measure. Noske supported the war loans, but he also argued in favour of a stronger political position for the Reichstag. In 1916 to 1918, he was the parliamentary speaker of a commission appointed by the government to investigate military procurement and related excess profits by contractors (Kommission für die Überprüfung der Kriegslieferungen). In that function, Noske helped to shed light on the business practices involved and to expand the authority of the parliament.

German Revolution and civil war
In October 1918, Noske became a member of the leadership of the SPD Reichstag group. When the Kiel mutiny started in early November, Prince Max von Baden, the new chancellor, sent Noske to Kiel to negotiate an end to the revolt. The mutineers welcomed Noske and elected him as Chairman of the Soldiers' Council (later "Governor"), as they considered him—a Social Democrat—to be on their side.: 65  Within days he had succeeded in restoring the authority of the officers and in making the mutineers who had remained in Kiel resume their normal duties. Max von Baden and his successor as chancellor, Friedrich Ebert, who was a close personal friend of Noske's, were pleased with Noske's achievement.: 72–73  Noske remained in Kiel until December 1918.As a result of the revolt of the Volksmarinedivision just before Christmas 1918, the representatives of the Independent Social Democrats (USPD) left the revolutionary government of the Council of the People's Deputies (Rat der Volksbeauftragten) at the end of the month and Noske was one of two Majority Social Democrats who took their place on 30 December. Within the government Noske was responsible for military affairs.

In January 1919, Noske and the Freikorps under his command were instrumental in putting down the so-called Spartacist revolt. Today, Marxist historians see this event more as an attempt by the Berlin workers to regain what they thought had been won in the November revolution and what they now seemed to be in the process of losing. The trigger was a trivial event: the head of the Berlin police, a member of the USPD, refused to accept his dismissal.: 155  The USPD called for a demonstration of solidarity but was itself surprised by the reaction as hundreds of thousands, many of them armed, gathered in the city centre on 5 January. They seized the newspapers and railway stations. Representatives from USPD and KPD decided to topple the Ebert government.
The next day, however, the gathered masses did not seize government buildings, as the expected support from the military had not materialized. Ebert began negotiations with the leaders of the uprising, but simultaneously prepared for a military response. Noske was made commander of the Freikorps and Ebert worked to mobilise the regular armed forces of the Berlin area on the government's side.: 162  From 9 to 12 January, on Ebert's orders, regular forces and Freikorps successfully and bloodily suppressed the uprising.: 163–168 A few days later, on 15 January 1919, members of the Freikorps Garde-Kavallerie-Schützendivision led by Hauptmann Waldemar Pabst abducted and murdered the socialists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Previously, Noske had personally ordered that Liebknecht's telephone line be monitored and Liebknecht's every movement be reported to Pabst.: 176 On 19 January 1919 elections to the Nationalversammlung (national assembly) were held. It met in Weimar and on 13 February 1919 the newly elected president Ebert appointed a new government, led by Philipp Scheidemann. Noske became Reichswehrminister (defence minister).Over the first half of 1919 Ebert and Noske repeated what they had done in Berlin throughout the Reich. Left-wing uprisings were crushed by brutal military force, employing both regular army and paramilitary Freikorps.: 183–196 As Reichswehrminister in the governments of Philipp Scheidemann and Gustav Bauer, who succeeded Scheidemann as chancellor in June 1919, Noske oversaw the initial reorganisation of the military after the collapse of 1918. Despite substantial misgivings, he ultimately supported signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which severely curtailed the ability of Germany to maintain an effective military. Beginning in the summer of 1919, there were plots by the Reichswehr leadership to seize power in a military coup. Noske was drawn into these discussions. Although he refused offers to serve as a dictator after a putsch, he never took any steps against the officers who made these offers and failed to report their activities to his fellow members of government.: 216 On 20 January 1920, the Treaty of Versailles came into force, restricting the German army to 100,000 men or less. On 28 February 1920 Noske, following orders of the Interalliierte Militärkontrollkommission, which oversaw Germany's compliance with the Treaty, dissolved the Freikorps Marinebrigaden "Ehrhardt" and "Loewenfeld". The highest ranking general of the Reichswehr, Walther von Lüttwitz, refused to comply, resulting in what became known as the Kapp Putsch.To restore order, Noske asked the chief of the Truppenamt in the Reichswehr Ministry, General Hans von Seeckt, to order the regular army to put down the putsch. Von Seeckt refused and the government was forced to flee from Berlin. However, a general strike called by the unions, the Social Democrats and the government, as well as the refusal of the bureaucracy to recognise the new (self-declared) chancellor Wolfgang Kapp, resulted in a quick collapse of the coup.: 223–229 As one of the conditions for ending the general strike, the unions demanded the resignation of Noske as Reichswehrminister. Moreover, some within the SPD were unhappy with his conduct during the crisis and deemed him to have been lacking in energy dealing with the putsch. He resigned on 22 March 1920. Otto Gessler succeeded him. Noske would be the last Social Democrat in this position during the Weimar Republic.

Later career and death
Noske was Governor (Oberpräsident) of the Province of Hanover from 1920 on. He became more conservative and supported Paul von Hindenburg in the elections for Reichpräsident in 1925 and 1932. However, as a Social Democrat he was first relieved of his duties in the spring of 1933 and then dismissed on 1 October by the Nazi government. Noske then moved to Frankfurt. In 1944 he was arrested by the Gestapo under suspicion of involvement in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler and imprisoned in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Noske was freed by advancing Allied troops from a Gestapo prison in Berlin.
He died in Hanover on 30 November 1946 from a stroke while preparing for a lecture tour of the United States. He is buried at Stadtfriedhof Engesohde in Hanover.

Reception
Noske has been called "one of the most forceful and at the same time controversial personalities of his time". For some, Noske had the courage to be (in his own words) "the bloodhound" and prevent Germany from falling into chaos and then tyranny of the type previously experienced by Russia after the Bolshevik October Revolution. Other historians have called him "a primitive brute, who conducted policy according to a simple friend-foe-pattern" and someone who was "unable to differentiate, who was in love with violence, who from his whole mentality would have fitted better into the NSDAP than into the SPD".: 185

The 1975 Hong Kong Urban Council election was held on 5 March 1975 for six of the 12 elected seats of the Urban Council of Hong Kong. 10,903 eligible voters cast their votes, higher than any previous election, though still less than a third of registered voters, less than five per cent of those eligible ratepayers, civil servants, professionals and other professions and a much tinier proportion still of the adult population. For the first time polling stations were set up in the New Territories satellite towns in Tsuen Wan, Yuen Long and Tai Po.
Incumbents Elsie Elliott, Hilton Cheong-Leen,  Denny Huang, Wong Pun-cheuk and Cecilia Yeung all retained their seats while Yeung won by a narrow margin. Henry Luk, a 52-year-old outspoken independent, editor of the pro-KMT Chinese-language newspaper Truth Daily, was the only new candidate elected.  Luk had notably campaigned for free democratic elections for the Legislative Council.

Official websiteSIM is an international, interdenominational Evangelical Christian mission organization. It was established in 1893 by its three founders, Walter Gowans and Rowland Bingham of Canada and Thomas Kent of the United States. 
The initials originally stood for "Soudan Interior Mission," Soudan being an older spelling of the Sudan region of West Africa. After various name changes and mergers, the mission simply goes by "SIM" today. In French-speaking countries it is known as "Société Internationale Missionnaire." SIM is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International.

History
SIM was founded in 1893, although the earliest elements of it were founded in 1860 ( with the British Syrian Schools Association in the Middle East. It is built up of a succession of partnerships and mergers.

West Africa - Sudan Interior Mission
In 1893 Walter Gowans, Rowland Bingham and Thomas Kent landed in Lagos, Nigeria. Their aim was to evangelize the "Soudan" region of Africa through the organization of the "Soudan Interior Mission." Gowans and Kent traveled to what is now Northern Nigeria with a Kru guide, Tom Coffee, but the two died of malaria. Bingham survived and returned to his home in Canada.Bingham reorganized the mission in 1898 as the "African Industrial Mission," with a hope to be self-supporting through the production and trade of cotton. In 1900, Bingham made a second attempt to establish a base in Africa but came down with fever and returned home. A third attempt in 1902 succeeded, which finally established a base 500 miles inland in Patigi, Nigeria. In 1906, the mission was once renamed "Sudan Interior Mission."After the initial base was set up, the mission branched out into other countries in West Africa, and then in the 1920s, to East Africa. Until 1998, SIM worked in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan and Togo.

South America
In 1907, George Allan and his wife Mary, née Stirling, from New Zealand, initiated the Bolivian Indian Mission (BIM), later known as Andes Evangelical Mission (AEM). Initially, the headquarters was located in San Pedro de Buena Vista before being transferred to the more accessible Cochabamba. Whereas the mission activities were relatively straightforward among the Quechua on the (highland) Altiplano, the real challenge began when the BIM reached out to the naked tribes of the inhospitable lowland Beni region. Here, while exploring the area prior to establishing a mission station, BIM-founder Allan narrowly escaped death from malaria, but young fellow missionary Henry C. Webendorfer succumbed to the disease. According to Allan's daughter Margarita Allan Hudspith, William Fulton McKay, Frank Chaplin and Charles Trotman were among the missionary pioneers in the rainforests of Bolivia.AEM joined SIM in 1982, and the work of SIM expanded to a new continent, South America.In 1999, Radio Mosoj Chaski was founded as an evangelical short wave station to reach the Quechua-speaking population in Bolivia. The Station is based in Cochabamba and broadcasts in the Quechuan languages for the rural population. It is operated by SIM, along with New Tribes Mission and Pioneers International. The station began broadcasting in April 1999 on shortwave at 3.310 MHz. Broadcasting commenced at 09:00 GMT in a signal described as "good".

South Asia
In the 1890s, two other small missions were formed to work in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), South India, and in the Philippines. In 1968, they joined forces and became the International Christian Fellowship (ICF). 
In 1989, ICF merged with SIM, which expanded the work of SIM to parts of Asia.

Southern Africa
In 1889, Andrew Murray a Dutch Reformed minister, Spencer Walton and Martha Osborn-Howe formed the Cape General Mission in Cape Town. After the Boer War, the Mission, now known as the South African General Mission, began to expand into parts of southern Africa, and then to islands in the Indian Ocean.
In 1965, \they became known as the Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF). They served in Angola, Botswana, Gabon, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
In 1998, AEF joined with SIM. This meant SIM workers were now operating in over 43 countries.

Middle East and North Africa
In 2016, branches of the Middle East Christian Outreach (MECO) joined hands with SIM. MECO was formed in 1959 by the merger of three organisations:
the Lebanon Evangelical Mission (founded 1860 as the British Syrian Schools Association by Elizabeth Bowen Thompson)
the Arabic Literature Mission (founded 1905 as Nile Mission Press)
the Middle East General Mission (dating back to 1898 where it was started as the Egypt Mission Band).The Canadian and Australian branches of MECO still exist independently of SIM.

East Africa
Founded in 1972 by four mission societies (AIM, SUM, SIM, and MAF), Across has since gone through a number of transitions in response to the changing conditions in South Sudan and partners outside Sudan. Across delivers literacy classes, Digital Audio Players (DAPs) (MP3 players) for literacy and social education, All Children Reading radio project (USAID) and runs Sudan Literature Centre which publishes in local language literacy materials for children and Christian literature for Christian church in South Sudan.

Organization
It was renamed SIM International in 1980, Society for International Ministries in 1992 and SIM in 2002.In 2017 SIM had more than 4,000 workers in over 70 countries Sending offices are located in Australia, Canada, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, France, India, South Korea, South Africa, South America, United Kingdom, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States. Some offices serve multiple countries. For example, the French office also covers Belgium. SIM also partners with many local mission organizations. For example, in Germany SIM is partners with DMG interpersonal e.V.

"Sometimes" is a song by The Stranglers, appearing as the first song on their debut album Rattus Norvegicus (1977). The song was written and sung by Hugh Cornwell, and credited to the band as a whole.
It was released as a single in Japan in 1977 with the B-side of "Go Buddy Go".

Overview
The song has a distinctive leitmotif played throughout on the keyboards, backed by a heavy bass riff which repeats throughout the song. The lyrics tell of an aggressive narrator's feelings towards a person, presumably their significant other, and it tells of their feelings of wanting to hit them. The song features a guitar and keyboard solo played in the call and response style during its climactic bridge before reprising its elongated chorus.

Writing and composition
The lyrics were written by Hugh Cornwell, inspired by an altercation between him and his girlfriend in which he caught her cheating on him and proceeded to hit her. The music was written predominantly by JJ Burnel with Hugh adding various pieces of music to Burnel's riff. The song is in the key of E minor, and features a large instrumental passage during its bridge.

Personnel
Hugh Cornwell – lead vocals, lead and rhythm guitar
Jean-Jacques Burnel – backing vocals, bass guitar
Dave Greenfield – Hammond organ, Hohner electric piano

Bodyguard is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. This particular story arc lasts 53 strips long and was published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer from July 2008 to September 2008. In 2009, the story arc was reprinted in the 21st compilation of the comic strip series, named Pugad Baboy 21. The story arc features perennially henpecked husband Tomas Sabaybunot, who appears as the main character for the first time since 1995's Col. Manyakis.

Synopsis
Tomas has been assigned to a VIP security detail. On his first day on the job, Tomas' superior introduces him to Cris, the son of a certain General Caldera, as one of four close-in bodyguards. However, the feeling of being a general's son and having a number of bodyguards gets to the boy's head, as he fears of reprisal by another youth whom he hit on the head with his .45-caliber pistol. The arrogance gets on Tomas' nerves, as he warns the child not to make him his errand boy (after he has asked to buy him a cigarette).
After going home, Tomas receives a call from the base, as Cris was kidnapped and two out of the three other guards were incapacitated. Tomas gets on the case and discovers that the third guard was not around at the time of the incident-Cris asked him to buy a cigarette. Further investigation leads Tomas to the father of Rene, the boy who was hit by Cris' pistol. The man said he already filed a case against Cris, but denies taking him. The two injured bodyguards say that Cris has been kidnapped four times, but his father always pays ransom. At the same time, the kidnapper was also wounded in the shoulder. However, when Tomas decides to talk to the general himself, the family lawyer discourages him because of the personal trauma.
Armed with the bodyguards' clues, Tomas visits a kali training school and asks Rene's father - a kali instructor - to demonstrate some moves that could match how the kidnapping took place. Tomas and Rene's father later question the bodyguards for their story. However, just as the two leave the hospital, a sniper fires at Tomas, forcing the two of them to take cover. Someone from the kali school calls Rene's father and tells him that one of his colleagues was also hit as well. Tomas - who was wearing a flak vest underneath his uniform - determines that since the slugs that hit them are 9mm rounds, the sniper could have used a VSS Vintorez or VSK-94. Alarmed at the danger, he asks Barbie and Paltik to go into hiding in Pampanga. However, Tomas' superior tells him that the general has put out a restraining order on him, claiming that he kidnapped Cris.
Determined to seek the truth, Tomas and Rene's father suit up in full battle gear and infiltrate the Caldera house, with the family lawyer's "cooperation." The lawyer admits that he is in charge of manipulating the Calderas' financial records. They finally see the general himself, supposedly comatose and connected to a respirator and a heart monitor, but when Rene's father quips that the family may have hired the team responsible for maintaining Apong Ferdie's body, Tomas deduces that the general is already dead.  
Rene's father and Tomas determine that while the general is dead, the family decided not to bury him so they could still receive pensions, allowing Cris to continue flaunting his wealth. However, the lawyer confirms that Cris was truly kidnapped this time around and Tomas has him arrange a meeting. The three escape the house after the security forces are alerted and head for an abandoned building in Binondo, where the meeting is scheduled to take place. Tomas sees snipers in the area and plans the assault with Rene's father. They start the attack but Rene's father senses that the defenders painted the windows and turned off the lights so they could use night-vision goggles. At this point, it is revealed that the man is actually Dado (see Aso), who single-handedly takes down the opposing force as a werewolf. Since the situation is a mess, Dado calls up Polgas to assist in policing the area.
Tomas, Dado, Polgas, and the lawyer meet the injured bodyguards. Tomas proposes that the scam be kept under wraps and declare Cris a fugitive in exchange for General Caldera being buried with full honors. However, when the bodyguards recognize one of Dado's kali knives as the one used in the kidnapping, Rene finally appears and admits that he kidnapped Cris as revenge for the pistol-whipping.
Rene explains that he escaped the hospital and tracked down Cris, whom he brought to Dado's veterinary clinic. He instructed the "patients" not to let him escape. When the group finds Cris at the clinic, the supposed abductee claims his father will come down hard on them, but shuts up after Dado asks him how he can summon the general from the dead. Using reverse psychology, Tomas gives Rene a chance to return Cris the favor. Dado finally says that since Cris drew first blood by hitting Rene, it was enough that he be punished by no longer abusing his father's wealth and status. Rene becomes friends with Cris and offers him a chance to train at the kali school. Polgas, Tomas, and Dado later settle for a drinking session with Igno, where they intend to use Dado's alter ego in scaring him.

Continuity
Dado, upon reuniting with Polgas, goes on to explain what has happened since the events of Aso. He managed to "convince" the magic mushroom farmers to cease their production and instead, produce coffee. As for his profession as a veterinarian, like the former story-arc-only character Father Marty before him, he has moved to Manila, possibly to Pugad Baboy, and opened a clinic there.
It is also revealed that Dado managed to beget a son, despite his lycanthropy, though it is unclear if Rene was conceived before or after the events of Aso. How much of Dado's lycanthropy was passed on to Rene is unknown, though it is shown that he is also able to communicate with dogs.
Dado can now transform at will, unlike in Aso that he cannot find the cure.

Real-life references
Dado's remark about General Caldera's body is a reference to the refrigerated remains of Ferdinand Marcos' body at the Marcos Museum in Ilocos Norte. "Apong Ferdie" is a portmanteau of the Ilocano term of endearment "apo" and one of Marcos' nicknames.
Tomas cited the disappearances of Rolando Galman's wife, girlfriend, and girlfriend's sibling as his rationale for having Barbie and Paltik go into hiding.
Tomas calls Cris an Anak ng Diyos (Son of God), a Filipino slang term for the children of highly placed officials (in this case, generals) who turn out to be spoiled brats.

Elselina van Houwening, or Elsje van Houwing (buried March 8, 1681) was the maid who helped in the escape of Hugo Grotius from Loevestein Castle in a book chest.
In 1619, when van Houwening was a maid for Hugo Grotius and Maria van Reigersberch in The Hague, Grotius was accused of treason and imprisoned in Loevestein Castle. She accompanied her employer in his confinement. Together with Grotius and his wife, a plan was hatched to smuggle Grotius out of the castle in a chest meant to be filled with books. Van Houwening played an active role in the implementation of the plan. She accompanied the chest on the boat trip on the Merwede and made sure that it was delivered to a friendly address in Gorinchem.
In 1625 she married notary William Fields, who also had been employed by Grotius and had been trained by him. The couple settled in The Hague, where her husband in 1642 was an Advocate at the Hof van Holland. Van Houwening died in 1681 and was buried in her hometown on March 8 of that year.

Raymond Macdonald Alden at Find a GraveThe Duchy of Rome (Latin: Ducatus Romanus) was a state within the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna. Like other Byzantine states in Italy, it was ruled by an imperial functionary with the title dux. The duchy often came into conflict with the Papacy over supremacy within Rome. After the founding of the Papal States in 756, the Duchy of Rome ceased being an administrative unit and 'dukes of Rome', appointed by the popes rather than emperors, are only rarely attested.

History
It is uncertain when exactly the Duchy of Rome was established, but it was most likely in the late 7th century, given the lack of earlier references to such a territory. The dux of Rome was subservient to the Exarch of Ravenna, who wielded the highest imperial authority in Italy. Within the exarchate, the two chief districts were the country about Ravenna where the exarch was the centre of Byzantine opposition to the Lombards, and the Duchy of Rome, which embraced the lands of Southern Etruria north of the Tiber and of Latium to the south as far as the Garigliano (with the exception of Casinum and Aquinum). There the Pope led the opposition to the Lombards.

Importance of Rome to Byzantine Italy
The strategic importance of the Duchy of the Pentapolis (Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, Ancona) and the Duchy of Perugia lay in their ability to retain control of the districts between Ravenna and Rome, and with them communication over the Apennine Mountains. If this strategic connection were broken, it was evident that Rome and Ravenna could not singly maintain themselves for any length of time. This was also recognized by the Lombards. The same narrow strip of land broke the connection between their Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento and the main portion of the king's territories in the north.  The Lombards made multiple attacks against this front to wrest control of the peninsula from the Byzantines.

Lombard attacks and increase in papal responsibility
In 728 the Lombard King Liutprand took the Castle of Sutri, which dominated the highway at Nepi on the road to Perugia. However, Liutprand, softened by the entreaties of Pope Gregory II, restored Sutri "as a gift to the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul".This expression of the Liber pontificalis was erroneously interpreted to mean that in this gift the beginning of the States of the Church was to be recognized. This is incorrect inasmuch as the Popes continued to acknowledge the imperial government, and Greek officials appeared in Rome for some time longer. It is true, however, that here for the first time the association of ideas on which the States of the Church were to be constructed is met. The Pope asked the Lombards for the return of Sutri for the sake of the Princes of the Apostles and threatened punishment by these sainted protectors. The pious Liutprand was undoubtedly susceptible to such pleas, but never to any consideration for the Greeks. For this reason he gave Sutri to Peter and Paul, that he might not expose himself to their punishment. What the Pope then did with it would be immaterial to him.The belief that the Roman territory (at first in the more restricted, but afterwards also in the wider sense) was defended by the Prince of the Apostles became more and more prevalent. In 738 the Lombard duke Transamund II of Spoleto captured the Castle of Gallese, which protected the road to Perugia to the north of Nepi. Pope Gregory III made a large payment to the duke to restore the castle to him. The pope then sought an alliance with Duke Transamund to protect himself against Liutprand. However, Liutprand conquered Spoleto, besieged Rome, laid waste the Duchy of Rome, and seized four important frontier fortresses (Blera, Orte, Bomarzo, and Amelia), thereby cutting off communication with Perugia and Ravenna.
This caused the pope in 739 to turn for the first time to the powerful Frankish kingdom, under the protection of which Boniface had begun his successful labours as a missionary in Germany. He sent to Charles Martel, "the powerful mayor of the palace" of the Frankish monarchy and the commander of the Franks in the famous battle at Tours, undoubtedly with the consent of the Greek dux, and appealed to him to protect the tomb of the Apostle. Charles Martel replied to the embassy and acknowledged the gifts, but was unwilling to offer aid against the Lombards, who were helping him against the Saracens.
Accordingly, the successor of Gregory III, Pope Zachary, changed the policy that had been previously followed toward the Lombards. He formed an alliance with Liutprand against Transamund, and in 741 received in return the four castles as the result of a personal visit to the camp of the king at Terni. Liutprand also restored a number of patrimonies that had been seized by the Lombards, and furthermore concluded a twenty years' peace with the Pope.
The duchy now had a respite from Lombard attacks. The Lombards fell upon Ravenna, which they had already held from 731 to 735. The Exarch Eutychius had no other recourse than to seek the aid of the pope. Liutprand did in fact allow himself to be induced by Zachary to surrender the greater part of his conquests. Nor was it unimportant that these districts too once owed their rescue to the pope. Only a short time after Liutprand's death in 744, Zachary was successful in further postponing the catastrophe.

Fall of the exarchate – Donation of Pepin
In 751 the Exarchate of Ravenna fell to the Lombards under King Aistulf. Rome, under Pope Stephen II, attempted diplomatic negotiations with Aistulf, and upon the failure of those negotiations, entreated King Pepin the Short of the Franks to intervene on its behalf. Pepin defeated the Lombards by 756 and granted the lands of the Duchy of Rome as well as the former Lombard possessions to the Papacy in what is referred to as the Donation of Pepin, marking the true beginning of the Papal States.

Dukes
The dukes were initially appointees of the exarch, but by mid-century they were created by the Pope. 

Peter ( –725)
Marinus (725– )
Stephen (fl. 743)
Toto (767–68)
Gratiosus (769–72)
John (772– )
Theodore (fl. 772×95)The office of Duke of Rome disappeared around 778–81, but there are scattered references to dukes among the Papal officers, who may be successors of the dukes of Rome:

Leoninus (fl. 772×95)
Sergius (815)

It is the statistics office of Switzerland, situated in Neuchâtel and attached to the Federal Department of Home Affairs.The Federal Statistical Office is the national service provider and competence centre for statistical observations in areas of national, social, economic and environmental importance. The FSO is the main producer of statistics in the country and runs the Swiss Statistics data pool. It provides information on all subject areas covered by official statistics.
The office is closely linked to the national statistics scene as well as to partners in the worlds of science, business and politics. It works closely with Eurostat, the Statistics Office of the European Union, in order to provide information that is also comparable at an international level.
The key principles upheld by the office throughout its statistical activities are data protection, scientific reliability, impartiality, topicality and service orientation.

History
With the founding of the Swiss Federal State in 1848, statistics gained in importance at national level: statistics became the task of the Department of Home Affairs under Stefano Franscini who conducted the first  population census in the newly founded federal state in 1850.
In 1860, the Federal Statistics Bureau (the present Federal Statistical Office) was founded in Bern, where it was located until 1998. Since 1998 all sections of the FSO have been centrally located in one building in Neuchâtel.
In the year of the FSO's foundation, a federal act was passed on the population census to be conducted every ten years. Ten years later the law was extended. In 1870, Parliament approved a brief law confined to organisational issues about "official statistical surveys in Switzerland". In 1992 this was replaced with the more up-to-date Federal Statistics Act. The new  Federal Constitution of 1999 included for the first time an article (Art. 65) regarding statistics. In 2002 the Charter of Swiss Public Statistics was approved. One of the aims of the Charter is to establish universal principles that are based upon international standards but that also take particularities of the Swiss statistical system into account. The bilateral cooperation agreement between Switzerland and the European Union in the area of statistics came into force in 2007.
The Statistical Yearbook of Switzerland was first published in 1891 and has since then been published without interruption by the FSO. Since 1987, the FSO has been making important statistical information available online in electronic form,  and in 1996 this service was extended and the STATINF database and website were added.

Mission
The FSO produces and publishes key statistical information on the current situation and development of the nation and society, of the economy and the environment. It completes these with comprehensive analyses, it creates scenarios of future developments and safeguards historical data.
Various methods are employed for data acquisition: direct interviews, more or less automated observation, analyses of administrative data, complete enumeration surveys and representative sample surveys.
The efficiency of modern statistical information systems is largely determined by the type of data acquisition. For legal and financial reasons, preference is given to the systematic use of existent data rather than to new direct surveys with the ensuing burden on those interviewed.
Statistical findings are disseminated in various forms and using varying channels: as tables or indicators accompanied by commentaries or graphs and maps, as printed documents or in electronic form, in standard issue or made-to-measure versions.

Population census
Business Census
National consumer price index (CPI)

The first federal population census took place in March 1850 under the direction of Federal Councillor Stefano Franscini. As well as counting the number of inhabitants, these were also asked about their sex, age, marital status, profession, occupation and religious denomination. Between 1860 and 2000 a census took place every ten years in December. The only exceptions to this 10-year rhythm were the population census of 1888 (brought forward as basis for the revision of the constituency allocations) and the population census of 1941 (delayed due to the mobilisation of the army in May 1940).
The census of 2000 was the last to use traditional methods. As of 2010 a fundamental change has been introduced: The population census, in a new format, will be carried out and analysed annually by the FSO. In order to ease the burden on the population, the information is primarily drawn from population registers and supplemented by sample surveys. Starting this year, only a small proportion of the population (about 5%) will be surveyed in writing or by telephone. The first reference day for the new census will be 31 December 2010.

Legal basis
Public statistics are anchored in the Swiss constitution. In the vote held on 18 April 1999 the Swiss electorate approved a total revision of the constitution, which now includes a statistics article (Art. 65) concerning the commissioning and competence of statistics:
"1 The federal authorities shall collect the necessary statistical data concerning the current status and changes in the population, the economy, society, education, research, territory and environment in Switzerland.
2 They shall be authorised to issue regulations with regard to the harmonisation and management of official registers with a view to minimising the work needed for collecting such information."The legal basis for public statistics in Switzerland is defined in more detail in various laws, principally in the Federal Statistic Act of 9 October 1992. The Federal Statistical Act provides a legal framework. The Act sets out the tasks and organisation of federal statistics as well as fundamental principles for data acquisition, publications and services. In particular it describes data protection principles.
The salient innovations in the 1992 Act are the coordination function of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office in its capacity as the Government's central statistical unit, the establishment of a multi-year statistical programme for overall planning of Swiss statistics, and the institution of the Federal Statistics Commission as an advisory body to the Federal Council (with representatives from academia, business, social partners as well as federal, cantonal and communal units).

Statistical EncyclopediaGB Tran is an American cartoonist and graphic designer. He is best known for his graphic novel, Vietnamerica, which won a Society of Illustrators Gold Medal and was included in Time's list of Top 10 Graphic Memoirs.

Biography
GB Tran grew up in Southern California with immigrant parents from Vietnam. During his childhood, he was largely indifferent to his background. In his late twenties, due to the deaths of his grandparents, he visited Vietnam for the first time and became more acquainted with his immigrant parents' and grandparents' history.
This experience inspired him to write Vietnamerica, a graphic novel depicting the struggles encountered by his grandparents in French Indochina and his parents during the Vietnam War and in their immigration to the United States. Vietnamerica was published in 2011.
Currently, GB Tran lives and works in the San Francisco Bay Area and teaches at California College of the Arts.

McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183 (1971), is a criminal case heard by the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court held that the lack of legal standards by which juries imposed the death penalty was not an unconstitutional violation of the due process clause portion of the Eighth Amendment.: 467  Justice Harlan wrote that writing rules for jury death penalty decisions was beyond current human ability.: 467  The context was public and philosophical scrutiny of the unequal application of the death penalty, especially in that blacks who killed whites were much more likely to have a death penalty imposed.: 467  McGautha was superseded one year later by Furman v. Georgia, which held that sentencing discretion must be narrowed "so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action."

Text of McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183 (1971) is available from: Justia  Library of Congress  Oyez (oral argument audio)Camp Boiro or Camp Mamadou Boiro (1960 – 1984) is a defunct Guinean concentration camp within Conakry city.
During the regime of President Ahmed Sékou Touré, thousands of political opponents were imprisoned at the camp.
It has been estimated that almost 5,000 people were executed or died from torture or starvation at the camp. According to other estimates, the number of victims was ten times higher: 50,000.

Early years
Sékou Touré became president of Guinea when the country gained independence from France in 1958. Over the years that followed, his regime became increasingly repressive, persecuting opposition leaders and dissidents from within the ruling Guinean Democratic Party (PDG).  The camp, situated in the center of Conakry, was originally called Camp Camyenne. It housed the Republican Guard under French colonial rule.  The political prison block in the camp was constructed with assistance from the Czechoslovak government. In 1961 the commandant had the windows reduced in size, since they were too large for condemned men.  The camp was renamed Camp Mamadou Boiro in 1969 in honor of a police commissioner who had been thrown from a helicopter in which he was transporting prisoners from Labé to Conakry.The camp was used to dispose of Touré's opponents.  Achkar Marof, actor and former Guinean ambassador to the United Nations, was recalled to Guinea in 1968, arrested and jailed at Camp Boiro.  He briefly gained his freedom in the 1970 coup attempt. His family learned in 1985 that he had been shot on 26 January 1971.  The so-called Labé plot, linked to French imperialism, was uncovered in February 1969.  Touré used this plot to purge the army and execute at least 13 people.  A total of 87 people were arrested and detained in the camp, including the Minister of Economy & Finance, Diawadou Barry. Two, Mouctar Diallo and Namory Keïta, died of starvation and dehydration only days after their arrest.  Fodéba Keïta, former Minister of Defense, was also arrested for alleged complicity in the Labé plot.  He was shot after forced starvation on 27 May 1969.

Aftermath of 1970 coup attempt
On 21 November 1970, the Portuguese Armed Forces based in the neighbor Portuguese Guinea, assisted by Guinean oppositionists, executed the Operation Green Sea, an amphibious raid against Conakry aimed to achieve several military and political objectives, including the liberation of Portuguese POWs and the attempt to overthrow the Touré regime. They captured Camp Boiro and liberated the prisoners. The camp commandant Siaka Touré managed to hide, but General Lansana Diané, minister of Defence, was captured. He later escaped and took refuge with the ambassador of Algeria.
The coup attempt failed, and in the aftermath many opponents of the regime were rounded up and imprisoned in Camp Boiro.
On 23 December 1970, the Bishop of Conakry, Raymond-Marie Tchidimbo, was arrested, and subsequently made a "confession".
Tchidimbo later wrote a book about his 8-year, 8-month stay at the camp.Alassane Diop, who was Senegalese in origin, a former Minister of Information in Guinea was arrested and held in Camp Boiro for ten years, returning to Senegal after his release.

The prisoners were given little food other than a scrap of bread the size of a box of matches in the morning, and a ladle of plain rice cooked in dirty water in the evening. There was never any meat except on days when Touré was performing some sacrifice.
Starting in January 1971 the prisoners were interrogated by a Revolutionary Committee headed by Ismaël Touré, half-brother of Sékou Touré and minister of the Economy.
Some prisoners were placed on the "black diet", meaning no food or water until they died. 
Prisoners could only show their courage by refusing to confess during torture sessions, and refusing to beg for food when placed on the black diet.Loffo Camara, former Secretary of State for Social Affairs, was hanged on 25 January 1971, the only woman killed at that time.
According to El Hadj Ibrahima Diane, an inmate for many years, from June 1972 until August 1973 at least four corpses were taken from the cells each day and thrown into mass graves in the rear yard of the prison.In 1975, France agreed to restore diplomatic relations after French prisoners were released from the camp. This reduced pressure on Touré. The book Prison D'Afrique by Jean-Paul Alata, a survivor from the camp, was banned from publication in France and had to be printed in Belgium.
Further incarcerations followed in the ensuing years. 
Diallo Telli was a popular politician, loyal to the regime, and former Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
He returned to Guinea in 1972 and was appointed Minister of Justice.
On 18 July 1976, Diallo Telli was arrested at his home and imprisoned at Camp Boiro.
In February 1977 five prominent prisoners were eliminated through the black diet: Diallo Telli, ex-ministers Barry Alpha Oumar, Dramé Alioune and Fode Cisse, and army officers Diallo Alhassana and Kouyate Laminé. The next month five more people died of starvation.The arrests and deaths continued. In August 1979 Bah Mamadou, an expatriate from Labé who had moved to France, returned to visit his family. Entering the country from Senegal, all occupants of his vehicle were arrested and jailed at Camp Boiro. Eight of the travellers - all but Bah Mahmoud himself - had died of the black diet within a month.
In September 1983 the government announced they had uncovered a plot to sabotage a meeting of the OAU planned to be held in Conakry the next year. Eighty one people were incarcerated in Camp Boiro.

Legacy
After the death of Sékou Touré in 1984, the military took power in a coup d'état and released many of the political prisoners at Camp Boiro.
Many of the leaders of the former regime were imprisoned, and later executed.
In the years that followed, the association of Victims of Camp Boiro fought for many years to maintain the memory of what had happened.
The council of ministers issued a communique on 27 August 1991 for renovation of the camp and construction of a memorial to all the victims, but no action followed.
The Association was forbidden to establish a museum in the former camp.
In a 2007 interview, Bobo Dieng, a former senior official in the Touré government, stated that there had been just 117 deaths at the camp.
It was not until 2009 that the interim president Moussa Dadis Camara met the members of the association.
That year, demolition of the camp buildings began, but it was not known whether a memorial would be erected.
As of 2010, there had been no commission of inquiry, and all documents about the camp were inaccessible or had been destroyed.

List of Six-man football stadiums in TexasBJFE Guitar Effects is a company which manufactures  effects pedals for use with instruments such as an electric guitar.  These pedals are commonly used by guitarists to modify the sound of their guitar before it reaches the amp.   The company is located in Sweden, and was founded in 2000 by Björn Juhl.  "BJFE" stands for  Björn Juhl Förstärkarelektronik (which is Swedish for Björn Juhl Amplifier Electronics).    Pedal types include distortion, overdrive, "vibe" (vibrato), compression, and equalization (EQ).   Due to the limited production and handbuilt nature, these pedals are considered "boutique" guitar effects.
BJFE pedals are all handmade by BJ and his wife Eva Juhl paints the lettering and pictures.  BJFE pedals typically follow a "color" naming scheme, and an adjective to describe the sound.  See below for examples.  Custom shop models are usually painted by Donner Rusk (aka "Donnerbox") in the USA.
BJFE drive pedals designs also tend to lend themselves well to "stacking", or cascading several pedals in successive order.  Björn has written a guide on this here.  Also, the drive pedals typically are dynamic in nature- showing different EQ or distortion depth as the input guitar level changes.  For example, the Honeybee overdrive may sound nearly clean with guitar volume at the lower range, but gritty and overdriven with the guitar volume at its maximum setting.

Founder history
Björn Juhl began creating models for production sale upon founding the company in 2000.  However, he began building effects units for guitar as early as 1981.   In 2000 Björn was displaying his repair skills at a guitar trade show, and made three pedals to demonstrate his skills.  Here he teamed up with Harri Koski from Custom Sounds in Stockholm, to begin a partnership distributing guitar effects which Björn designed to a worldwide customer base.Björn Juhl has two kids, a daughter and a non binary child named Martina. His daughters name is Marlene and music is a big pleasure for her. She is going in her father's footsteps.
BJF Electronics initially started in June 1999 as an amp repair business.  Björn repaired all kinds of things from a Tubon (a kind of early synthesiser used as an electric bass by pop bands who couldn't afford a Fender Bass or a Hagstrom Bass), to a Music Man amp that had been used to test how to take the live and neutral currents out of a three phase connection. Björn handled the extreme and difficult cases that other repairmen wouldn't touch because they thought they'd take too much time or were considered hopeless repair opportunities.

Construction and philosophy
BJFE pedals are enclosed in a 110x60x30mm chassis, in an ELFA K-430 enclosure for most pedals. The circuit boards are wrapped in neoprene, which is a kind of rubber used in diving suits. The neoprene is capable of withstanding heat, water, and other fluids and it cushions the electronic components inside.  The circuit board is also sealed to preserve trade secrets.
The first BJFE pedals were painted in nitrocellulose—beginning in 2002 the pedals are handpainted in oil.  Oil is much more durable, and ages well.  Björn Juhl states that the colors are chosen to provide a pleasant palette.  Each model comes with unique artwork inside the back pedal cover, painted by hand.

Models
Current models listed here, along with a description.  A more full description of all the BJFE pedals complete with their history can be found on the BJFE Pedal Descriptions independently maintained by  David Cittadini on the thread Archived 2011-07-25 at the Wayback Machine on the BJFE Forum.

Fuzz
Candy Apple FuzzA crude fuzz, with octave function if needed and dying moans of gated fuzzPink Purple FuzzA more tame fuzz.  Here, the fuzz knobs act differently - The first half of rotation will give dynamic fuzz, suitable for overdrive, and second half will give compressed fuzz effects with most guitars.

Distortion and overdrive
BJFE overdrive pedals add a "touch sensitivity" to the distortion in most cases- picking lightly or slight reductione in the volume knob position reduce the distortion.

Honeybee OverdriveThe most dynamic, touch sensitive pedal from BJFE.   According to Björn, this pedal fits most styles and "stacks" well with most other pedals. On a clean-sounding amp HB can be used to get distortion on forceful notes as controlled by picking force. This can be used on guitars with flatwound strings for a mellow jazz sound or roundwound strings for a vintage style light distortion. In pedal systems with multiple drive pedals, HB can be connected last to soften the response and even give a low mid-range hump to bright amplifiers and provide a ceiling-effect for the upper treble frequencies.Dyna Red DistortionDistortion ranges from very light to heavy. It is used mostly for high gain sounds but it also matches particularly well for light "break up" tone with some amps.  The "drive" knob on this pedal controls the amount of distortion and sustain. Lower settings give uniform distortion patterns which will be input amplitude sensitive (i.e. the unit distorts more the harder you strike the strings).  There is no definite clipping point - but rather different shades of distortion as amplitude changes. Higher settings give more compression and less touch sensitive response, and at maximum output will be heavily compressed while still retaining clarity and increasing sustain.Emerald Green Distortion MachineModeled after a VOX AC-15 Twin 10 amp.  EGDM gives a range of distorted sounds that are a bit less aggressive than the Dyna Red Distortion and also more compressed.  The distortion depth is a bit less than the Dyna Red Distortion as well.  This is done by use of a specific amplifier overload function and a slight ’ducking’ effect which can be noticed with high input levels. A specific equalizer curve is also used to complement this tone.

Research Models

Compressor Pedals
Pine Green CompressorSubtle compression pedal.  This was originally designed for a set of Beatles songs Björn's band was playing in, to give the kind of clean sound needed from the amp he was using. It works equally well with single coil, P90, and humbucking guitars  It was introduced as a model since Andreas of Custom Sounds Stockholm found Björn's old unit on one of the shelves at his store and asked to borrow it.

EQ Pedals
Sea Blue EQEQ in pedal form, designed to match the piezo-acoustic guitars and work as a booster addressing frequency bands with treble and bass controls that you don't find on your amp.  As a result the pedal allows you to further EQ beyond what your amp provides, while not fighting its own EQ.

Modulation Pedals
Mighty Green MinivibeDesigned to work primarily before distortion, and gives a traditional vibe sound.  This pedal does not have Univibe type sounds, but more vibrato.

Boost Pedals
Baby Pink BoosterVolume boost pedal. This is a booster pedal intended to use between a low-level instrument such as electric guitar and an amplifier. It’s intended to place in signal chain after overdrive pedals in order to boost level rather than distortion - hence its gain of 18dB (or 8 times). You can of course use it in front of an overdrive to boost the gain for more distortion.

Relationship to Mad Professor Amplification
Björn was asked by his BJFE pedal distributor, Harri Koski, to consider designing amplifiers.   Björn was fairly busy building and designing pedals for the BJFE line, and did not have the time to also build amplifiers. It was suggested a new company be created where Björn could design the effects and amplifiers, but they would be constructed and distributed under the name Mad Professor Amplification. These are pedals and amplifiers designed by Björn but not hand built by him.

Allmusic stated, "Heavier than real heavy…things, crushing highlights such as 'The Choir of Prophecy Fulfilled' and 'This Side of the Nightmare' basked in uncompromisingly ruthless death metal ferocity, while the slower passages heard on 'Reflections of Ruin' and the especially malevolent 'This Curse' were reminiscent of punishing Southern sludgecore."

Christian Bjelland (30 May 1858 – 9 May 1927) was the founder of Chr. Bjelland & Co A/S, Norway's largest canned goods producer and amongst the largest in Scandinavia.  He became one of the great industrialists of his time and in 1908 was made a Knight, 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for his contribution to building the Norwegian canning industry.

Background
Christian Bjelland was born on the farm Åreskjold at Høyland in Rogaland, Norway. His parents were farmers who raised a family of six. In 1868, the  family moved to Stavanger where Bjelland attended school in the neighborhood of Bjergsted. His formal education ended after fifth grade.

Chr. Bjelland & Co A/S
After several years as a trading officer and inspector in various manufacturing shops, he became engaged in foreign trade, especially consignment shipments of fish to England. During 1882,  Bjelland founded an export business.  The initial focus of the  business was established in fresh salmon, trout and halibut.  In 1889 Chr. Bjelland started processing anchovies in a tin can. In 1893 he picked up the production of sardines packed with a hermetic seal.
The company became most famous for its sardines on tins featuring the images of notable Norwegians including explorer, Fridtjof Nansen. Particularly successful was the King Oscar brand for which Christian Bjelland received royal permission to use the image of Oscar II of Sweden .  The King Oscar brand became well known worldwide and is still popular in the U.S.A. as well as Australia.Bjelland sardines have been an important part of Norwegian culture throughout the 19th and 20th century.  The company slogans and advertising are still remembered by many Norwegians to this day.  These include the company logo known as "The Man with the Fish" painted by Theodor Kittelsen, and the slogan Ikke noe snikk-snakk, Bjellands hermetikk, takk, which translates into "No chit-chat, Bjellands canned goods, thanks".The company was led by Christian Bjelland's son Ragnvald Bjelland (1886-1955), then by his sons Christian Wilhelm Bjelland (1913–1984) and Frithjof Ragnvald Bjelland (1914-1992). The company remained involved in the canning industry until 1983 when Christian Bjelland's great-grandson Christian Bjelland  (born 1954) sold this section of the company to Norway Foods Ltd. (now Rieber & Søn).
