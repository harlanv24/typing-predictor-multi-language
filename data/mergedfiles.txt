Duo Interpretation, or often simply called Duo Interp, or just Duo, is an official speech event of Stoa USA, the National Speech and Debate Association, the National Catholic Forensics League, National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, American Forensics Association, and the National Forensics Association.  The event involves a pair of performers acting out a literary piece or program under certain constraints, including not making eye contact nor touching their partner, and not using props. Pieces used often include published books, movies, short stories, plays, or poems.  Participants may cut anything out of their piece, but cannot add any dialogue. This event can either be dramatic or humorous.

Performance
Like other interpretation events, props and costumes are not allowed, and the performers rely on things such as pantomime to convey what is happening. Duo Interpretation differs from the other events in the sense that the most important element is how well the duo partners work with each other. Partners are not allowed to look at each other or touch each other, so they must come up with other means to convey two characters talking to each other, physically interacting with each other, etc. Like in other interpretation events, the competitors will often pick a point on the wall in front of them to look at, pretending it is their subject. The stance is key in Duo Interpretation, where even the slightest shift could indicate a change.
Timing is also crucial when it comes to conveying physical interactions. For instance, if one partner lifts and swipes their hand as if to slap someone, the other partner must flinch and "be hit" in response. These movements must be timed carefully and are arguably the most challenging aspect of the event. Teams will often create complex "choreography" or "tech" (the term differs based on region) to showcase how well they can perform together.
Interpretation is highly valued in this event.  Performances may be dramatic, humorous, or a blend of both.  Performers often twist the meanings of words for comic effect or play on an unintentional pun.  Other common ways to change the meaning of the text is to sing, dance, gesture, or simply change the tone of your voice.
Some movements, such as lying on the floor or kneeling with both legs, are prohibited at some tournaments, but performers can get around these rules by keeping one limb raised.
A duo can be no longer than ten minutes  (any team exceeding ten minutes is given a thirty-second grace period before having any points deducted. There is no definite time minimum, but the unofficial consensus is that seven minutes is a good minimum time.)

Elements of the Duo
The duo usually begins with a teaser or short "taste" of the forthcoming duo. Typically, though there is no rule governing the order of these elements or their length, this lasts 1 to 2 minutes before the performers break character to perform their self-written "intro". The intro serves to introduce the piece and its author, as well as provide the performers to simultaneously present the theme or storyline of their piece and infuse their own creativity. After the intro, which is usually brief due to original word restrictions, the duo resumes through its end.

Duo InterpretationAlbert Haller Tracy (June 17, 1793 – September 19, 1859) was an American lawyer and politician from New York.

Life
He was the son of Dr. Philemon Tracy (1757–1837, a physician) and Abigail (Trott) Tracy. He pursued classical studies, and later studied medicine. In 1811, he removed to New York, where he abandoned medicine and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1815, commenced practice in Buffalo, and became a prominent attorney. In 1825, Tracy married Harriet Foote Norton, daughter of Ebenezer F. Norton, a New York state Assemblyman and later U.S. Representative. The couple had two sons: Albert Haller Tracy (b. 1834) and Francis Walsingham Tracy (b. 1839).
Tracy was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 16th, 17th and 18th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1819, to March 3, 1825. He was Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Treasury (17th Congress). In February 1825, Tracy was brought forward as a compromise candidate for U.S. Senator from New York, and was nominated by resolution in the State Senate, but the different majority in the State Assembly refused to concur, and nobody was elected.
In March 1826, Tracy was appointed as Judge of the Eighth Circuit Court, but declined to take office. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1830 to 1838, and was aligned politically with the Anti-Masons and later the Whigs. Tracy sat in the 53rd, 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th, 58th, 59th and 60th New York State Legislatures.
Tracy was involved in business and cultural organizations within Buffalo throughout his life. He was one of the nine original members of the Buffalo Harbor Company, which was organized in 1819. Tracy was a member of the first board of directors of the branch of the United States Bank, which was established in Buffalo in 1826. He was one of the incorporators in 1846 of the University at Buffalo. Tracy was also the president of the Buffalo Water Works Company from 1855 to 1859.He died in Buffalo on September 19, 1859, and was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery.

Sodium channel subunit beta-3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SCN3B gene. Two alternatively spliced variants, encoding the same protein, have been identified.

Function
Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane glycoprotein complexes composed of a large alpha subunit and one or more regulatory beta subunits. They are responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons and muscle. This gene encodes one member of the sodium channel beta subunit gene family, and influences the inactivation kinetics of the sodium channel.

Clinical significance
Mutations in the gene are associated with abnormal cardiac electrophysiology.

Okahukura railway station was a station on the North Island Main Trunk in New Zealand.The station opened when work started on the eastern end of the Stratford–Okahukura Line. It was served by through trains on that line from 3 September 1933 (though rails were completed by 7 November 1932) to 2009, being 9.65 km (6.00 mi) east of Tuhua. The Public Works Department operated a limited train service as far as Matiere from 1922. A junction with the NIMT at Ongarue, and even as far north as Puketutu (via Mokauiti and Ohura) had been considered before the Okahukura route was decided in 1911. Work started shortly after Sir Joseph Ward had turned the first sod, including the construction of workshops and 4 railway houses at Okahukura, and the station opened the following year. It seems that the initial service was provided by coaches attached to goods trains.A cattle yard and goods shed were added in 1915. In 1916 a porter was paid 9 shillings a week.

Patronage
Passenger numbers peaked in 1934, as shown in the graph and table below -

The same year they held their first exhibition displaying the work of 57 women. From 1908 to 1912 Edwell exhibited at The Society of Arts and Crafts of NSW. In 1919 Edwell was a founding member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society.Along with several solo shows in Melbourne from 1915 through 1934, Edwell was included in a 1923 group show with A.M.E. Bale and Jo Sweatman at the Melbourne Athenaeum.Edwell died in 1962 in Sydney.

Images of works by Bernice E. Edwell on Art Gallery of New South WalesA quantity surveyor (QS) is a construction industry professional with expert knowledge on construction costs and contracts.  Qualified professional quantity surveyors are known as Chartered Surveyors (Members and Fellows of RICS) in the UK and Certified Quantity Surveyors (a designation of AIQS) in Australia and other countries. In some countries such as Canada, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius, qualified quantity surveyors are known as Professional Quantity Surveyors, a title protected by law.Quantity surveyors are responsible for managing all aspects of the contractual and financial side of construction projects. They help to ensure that the construction project is completed within its projected budget. Quantity surveyors are also hired by contractors to help with the valuation of construction work for the contractor, help with bidding and project budgeting, and the submission of bills to the client.

Duties
The duties of a quantity surveyor are as follows:

Cost estimate, cost planning and cost management
Analyzing terms and conditions in the contract.
Predicting potential risks in the project and taking precautions to mitigate such.
Forecasting the costs of different materials needed for the project.
Prepare tender documents, contracts, budgets and other documentation.
Take note of changes made and adjusting the budget accordingly.
Tender management including preparation of bills of quantities, contract conditions and assembly of tender documents
Contract management and contractual advice
Valuation of construction work
Claims and dispute management
Lifecycle costing analysis

Coxsackie Light was a lighthouse near the town of Coxsackie, New York on the northerly end of the Low island northerly of Coxsackie island and on the westerly side of the main channel of the Hudson River.
The lighthouse was first established in 1830 and the last tower was first lit in 1868.  The lighthouse was deactivated in 1940.  The lighthouse was a red square tower with granite trimmings and a red dwelling on stone pier.  The lantern housing was black.  The light was 32 feet high fixed white light.  The original lens was a sixth order Fresnel lens.
The Archives Center at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History has a collection (#1055) of souvenir postcards of lighthouses and has digitized 272 of these and made them available online.  These include postcards of Coxsackie Light  with links to customized nautical charts provided by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Epic of Utnoa (Esperanto: Poemo de Utnoa) is an epic by the Catalan writer Abel Montagut, published in Vienna, Austria, in 1993 and originally written in Esperanto.  It consists of seven cantos, and of 7095 verses in all, in an Alexandrine-derived Metre – a variant featuring 15 syllables rather than the usual 14. The songs are inspired by major epics from world literature such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Aeneid, the Bible, the Ramayana, the Iliad, and by modern authors such as Papini, Asimov and others – especially as far as the treatment of the primaeval flood is concerned. The book is contextualized by a foreword (by William Auld) and an afterword by Probal Dasgupta. William Auld called Poemo de Utnoa – “the first truly remarkable epic-science fiction poem in the world, and one of the very few modern epics” and Gerrit Berveling called it “impressively beautiful -- and at its most profound very wise – epic”

Content
It is already clear in the first canto that the history of human beings will be narrated in a symbolic mode; furthermore, the narration takes place from an outsider's viewpoint – it is an extraterrestrial population that visits Earth and studies the behavior of Terrans. The extraterrestrials inquire whether the Terrans deserve to be helped to avoid an impending disaster or whether it is better for the extraterrestrials to wait for the destruction to happen in order to be able, afterwards, to colonize the planet for their own use. The main debate concerns the question as to whether the Terrans are rational or not, given their inclinations towards vengeance, hatred and mass murder. The conclusion reached is that the extraterrestrials must warn at least one Terran that he should build a large ship to survive the flood: the extraterrestrial Emme conveys this warning to Utnoa, a character corresponding to the mythical figure Noah.
What follows, in the second canto, is the controversy between the two parties among the extraterrestrials. One of them has changed sides; he lived among the Terrans incognito for some time; his earth-born wife and son have been murdered. Now he and his supporters want this irrational species exterminated. On Earth, the rivalry between Babylon and Nineveh puts Utnoa in serious danger, for he is a nomad, caught in the cross-fire. Along with his brother Lashmu, he visits a Babylonian oracle to ask what the message communicated to Utnoa means. Meanwhile, the temple guards attached to the Ishtar Temple in Babylon (on the head priest's orders) launch a violent attack against the nomads; when Utnoa tells his people they need to build a ship, very few of them agree to do the work; most of them go off to fight the city-dwellers.
The third canto depicts various aspects of the life of the extraterrestrial Nayans, focusing on a special intellectual game, a wedding, and other everyday practices that manifest a highly developed and articulated standard of collective living. Meanwhile, on Earth, Utnoa's followers have begun to build the ship, with support from Shabda, queen of Ur, but in the face of opposition from the humiliated general Ulmi, angered by a coincidental hunting accident.
In the fourth canto, the extraterrestrials hostile to the Dilmunites (the nomads) hatch a conspiracy. Arunni feeds the prophetess Filge with thoughts against those building the ship. She passes them on to the queen, who ignores her, but what she says provokes general Ulmi even further. Afterward a deserter, Tudar, comes from the city to the shipbuilders and tells them, in detail, that the queen is dead and that there will be a major offensive against the Dilmunites very soon. In fact, even before he finishes telling them the whole story – in a filmlike sequence – General Ulmi, seeking revenge, launches the attack. Most of the shipbuilders are massacred: Lashmu, Utnoa's family, and others, including the deserter Tudar; and Ulmi, who led the offensive, is also killed.
The fifth canto features another assembly of the Gobans (the extraterrestrials are from the planet Goba, destroyed when their sun went nova). In order to compensate for the hostile action by Arunni, it is agreed that Utnoa – demoralized and relatively defenceless – should be encouraged by using a drug called anoŭdo. Inna visits Earth and administers it to Noah. Under the influence of the drug, he sees the poet Valmiki, who shows him the enormous achievements humankind will perform in future if he is able to save it; he travels from the Great Wall of China to the island of Sri Lanka; he then meets the Japanese painter Hokusai who proceeds to display other Asian wonders. Thus Utnoa is accompanied by two eminent guides per continent; for Europe, first Phidias and then Maria Sklodovska (also known as Marie Curie); for Africa, first Hypatia and then Sunjata Keita; and for America, first Frida Kahlo and then Neil Armstrong. On every continent, Utnoa contemplates the remarkable accomplishments, mainly but not exclusively architectural, which would render meaningful the heroic effort with his he is building the ark that is about to save human beings, who then be capable of the achievements that he is given an opportunity to visualize. His drug-induced travels through Oceania and Antarctica is quicker and unaccompanied. On his return, Utnoa leads the ceremonial mourning of his brother Lashmu – who had been supervising the shipbuilding work – and, to the reader's surprise, abandons the project and burns the partially built ship.
In the sixth canto, both the extraterrestrials supporting Noah's community and those who disapprove of him are surprised to see that even after his illuminating travels into the future Utnoa should have chosen to burn the ship and to withdraw into the wilderness with the few survivors who were with him. A small group of those Dilmunites who had not been present arrive. Jubal tells Utnoa about the battles waged by the other Dilmunites, who had left and joined forces with other nomadic tribes to besiege Nineveh. Negotiations for peace failed; the ruler of Nineveh took many prisoners, including Ukud, the chief of the Leonite tribe; he had Ukud tortured and murdered. Some Leonites wanted to take revenge at once, while some of their allies preferred to wait for others and join forces; they failed to resolve this controversy. When the Leonites left, there was a terrible battle between the citizens of Nineveh and the nomadic combatants. Given their unequal strength, the nomads were routed. The few Dilmunites who survived the massacre realized that it had been a mistake not to have agreed to take part in building the ship; they would like to reconsider. This was why Jubal came back in order to tell Utnoa and others what had happened.
The seventh canto ends the epic. The Dilmunites pick up the pieces and, in their camp, put their life back together as best they can. Noah gets engaged and marries; they receive what they take to be divine signals, which prompt them to start building the ship at the city of Eridu. The extraterrestrial Gobans react again: Jishka administers a drug to Utnoa, whose visions this time are guided by the extraterrestrial Roa Numu. He is now shown future evils that will come to pass if he does indeed rescue humankind – evils such as corruption, rapacity, drug dealing, organized crime, all the way to the bombing of Hiroshima as well as the environmental disaster and pollution associated with non-human causes. There are references to individualism, dictatorship and Nazism. After he comes out of the dream, Utnoa forgets the vision of future evils, which he attributes to some unconscious factors. The closing lines of the epic are open-ended: the impression is given that the ship will indeed be built. The reader already knows the Biblical legend and is spared an explicit repetition.

Style
The verses are of fifteen syllables, a rare format in modern poetry, but long verses go well with the epic genre and were used in several classical epics. The text pays frequent homage to those epics; for example, the second canto begins with the line "When rosy-fingered dawn ushered in the sun", invoking Homer's metaphor for dawn. In order to keep the archaic style from obstructing the reader, vivid comparisons (involving the dynamics of the animal kingdom) are added; these place the narration in an ecological context: Like a lion that ..., Like a rhinoceros that ... Probal Dasgupto in his afterword calls them ‘Abelian comparisons’ and studies their systematic use by Montagut.
The text also features occasional detailed explanations of the various elements of the whole, such as the attractions of the city of Babylon. The metrical structure that lends fluency to these descriptions also endows with a certain majesty the few epigrammatic expressions of conventional sentiments, such as Hazardo suverenas sur nia mondo drakone, ‘It is Chance that holds draconian sway over our world’.

Message
At the level of content, we must emphasize that this text recontextualizes the familiar myth of a primaeval flood with fabulations about life on other planets; such inventions typically flourish in writing that draws on pseudo-science and does not aim for serious literary goals; here, however, the memes serve the fictive-literary purposes of this particular epic.
Concerning ideology, the author uses every opportunity to show why these aliens in general and certain terrestrial humans in particular are committed to peaceful practices and the avoidance of violence. The aliens are of course shown using scientific progress in order to enjoy a high standard of living. The inventions that the aliens use reminds us of science fiction films. This text uses the extraterrestrial trope in order to communicate a contemporary message urging readers to aspire to a highly articulated, humane form of life. This is how Numu speaks, for instance:
"I am a rational being from a civilization 
far more advanced. We have resources at our disposal
that you can’t imagine, and we are thus able to explore
the universe at far more depth and gain insight"The use of extraterrestrials is a trope that elicits the modern reader's complicity; its purpose is to take over the functions that divine interventions performed in the classical epics.
From the perspective of the Dilmunites (the nomadic tribe led by Utnoa), it makes sense to obey what they interpret as signals or messages from the gods. The modern reader understands that the sources of those signals or messages are most often the extraterrestrials, who are to be seen only as rational persons culturally advanced in comparison to the nomadic Dilmunites. Of course the Dilmunites are justified in attributing to their gods what we would call natural disasters; and we must bear in mind that the story turns on an impending natural disaster – a flood, in the terms that Terrans understand, caused by the approaching meteorite, which only the extraterrestrials can conceptualize.
The repeated references to the impending disaster are in keeping with the on the whole sombre mood of the text (especially in the seventh canto), a mood that reflects the modern reader's perception of Noah's predicament. In this connection, let us quote Numu Roa again – this is how he presents one part of the terrible images that Utnoa is shown:
"Here are those who will kill their own father, their mother, their wife, or even their own infants in their cradles.
Look at those kidnappers, those who don’t balk at assaulting women and innocent children to satisfy that perverted lust of theirs.
And these are the worst criminals that humankind will produce,
they will kill other people as easily as they breathe in or out:
feeling-blind mafiosi who should be buried in unremembered tombs without a name:
it would have been better if no womb had ever given them birth"The trope of exodus, on which Dilmunites are shown as having pinned their hopes, is associated with the non-violent inclination for peaceful coexistence of all communities and an aversion for military aggression and destructiveness. They believe that if they live in accordance with their non-violent principles, then they will reach the mythical promised land, Dilmun; this destination that the nomads long for is an island symbolically comparable to the realm to which Don Quixote promises to take Sancho if he behaves – the ínsula Bararataria – despite the considerable differences between the two texts.

It used to be the only way to quickly transport large bundles of letters over long distances, until motorised vehicles became more widespread. Mail is still delivered by animals in a few remote locations that lack vehicular road access.
The term "snail mail" is a derogatory retronym used to refer to the delivery of letters in contrast to the immediacy of electronic mail.

Camels
In Australia camels were used to transport mail and supplies from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs until around 1929 when the railroad superseded it.  The journey of around 520 kilometers took Afghan cameleers (Muslims and expert cameleers came from around the British Empire, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, signed a 3 years contract and often married and created families in Australia) around four weeks.  The service was celebrated by descendants of the cameleers in 2002.

Dogs
Dogs were used to deliver mail when pulling a dogsled.  Dogsled mail saw limited use in the northern parts of Alaska and Canada during the Klondike gold rush (1896–1903)  In the early years of Alaska settlement, there was no regular mail service to the interior post offices during the winter months (October to May), although individuals might agree to transport letters to coastal areas. Regular service seems to have begun around the 1910s, replaced in the 1930s by small aircraft.

Horses
Horses were a primary method of delivering mail and messages for many years in different countries around the world.  Riders on horseback could take small bundles quickly, while carts pulled by horses could take large amounts of mail very long distances.  
Relay rider networks were a common feature of every ancient empire.  They were primarily for the exclusive use of the government or military and carried no civil correspondence as a rule.  Later, post riders became popular when there was an obvious demand for the transportation of public correspondence.
The Hanseatic League had a regular mounted service as early adopters the year 1274 between the principal towns of the League as well as the fortified castles which protected the merchants in their commerce.  On behalf of the far-flung Habsburg dynasty of The Holy Roman Empire, Franz von Taxis set up a courier network that grew to cover all of Western Europe in the middle of the 16th century.  Permanent post stations were built about a day's journey apart.  Elizabethan England really started using post riders in earnest, being much more open to public use despite government restrictions.The Pony Express was a fast mail service crossing the North American continent from the Missouri River to the Pacific coast, operating from April 1860 to November 1861.
Messages were carried on horseback relay across the prairies, plains, deserts, and mountains of the western United States. It briefly reduced the time for mail to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to around ten days before being replaced by the First Transcontinental Railroad and the telegraph.
Regular mail delivery is now provided by horses in limited areas where other forms of transportation are not practical. For example, some towns in mountainous parts of Sichuan and Tibet, in China, are served by horse couriers.  The village of Supai, in the bottom of the Grand Canyon of Arizona, United States, is served by a regular mule train from the canyon's rim.

Birds
The use of homing pigeons to carry messages is as old as the ancient Persians from whom the art of training the birds probably came. The Greeks conveyed the names of Olympic victors to their various cities by this means. Before the telegraph this method of communication had a considerable vogue amongst stockbrokers and financiers. The Dutch government established a civil and military system in Java and Sumatra early in the last century, the birds being obtained from Baghdad. Details of the employment of pigeons during the siege of Paris in 1870–71 France led to a revival in the training of pigeons for military purposes.
Numerous societies were established for keeping pigeons of this class in all important European countries; and, in time, various governments established systems of communication for military purposes by pigeon post. When the possibility of using the birds between military fortresses had been thoroughly tested attention was turned to their use for naval purposes, to send messages from the coast to ships at sea.
Pigeons have also been used by news agencies, such as Reuters, and by private individuals. Governments have in several countries established lofts of their own. Laws have been passed making the destruction of such pigeons a serious offense; premiums to stimulate efficiency have been offered to private societies, and rewards given for destruction of birds of prey. Pigeons have been used by newspapers to report yacht races, and some yachts have actually been fitted with lofts.

Reindeer
From around 1899 reindeer were used to deliver mail in Alaska for the U.S. postal service.  The first route was established by Sheldon Jackson and ran from St. Michael to Kotzebue, with another managed by William Kjellmann going between Unalakleet and Nome.  Distances of 30–50 miles were covered by the service, with the reindeer carrying up to 300 pounds (140 kg) of mail.

Jeffrey E. Erickson (1958–1992) and Jill Sandra Erickson (née Cohen; 1964–1991) were an American married criminal couple known for committing a series of violent bank robberies. 
In 1990 and 1991 the couple was believed to have committed eight bank robberies in the Chicago metropolitan area by the time federal authorities caught up with them. The couple's  modus operandi was for Jeffrey to announce a hold-up while wearing a fake beard and carrying a police scanner, while Jill prepared the getaway cars. She killed herself after a high-speed chase, while Jeffrey killed himself after disarming a female United States marshal and killing two men: a marshal and a police detective. Jeffrey was wounded in a shootout before the latter victim succumbed to his wounds.
The 1996 film Normal Life was based upon the Ericksons' exploits.

Early life
Jeffrey was born to Jack Erickson, a telephone company middle manager, and June, a stay-at-home mother. He was raised in Morton Grove, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, together with his older brother, Jim. In 1977, after graduating from Niles West High School, where he was a member of the swim team, Jeffrey joined the United States Marine Corps, where he acquired excellent marksmanship skills.Jill was the younger of two girls raised by adoptive parents Carl Cohen, a pharmacist, and Fran Cohen, a child education specialist, in Niles, Illinois.Jeffrey met Jill in a bar near her home on the day she turned 17. He nicknamed her "Gorgeous" due to her long blond hair. Jeffrey later stated that "Jill and I were crazy about each other". After dating for six months, they moved in together, partly as a result of the strain Jill was feeling due to her parents' impending divorce. Jeffrey and Jill were married in a civil ceremony on July 29, 1983.

Married life and criminal career
Jeffrey found work as a truck driver and chauffeur, while Jill, who worked as a lab technician, was a chemistry student at Loyola University Chicago, where she was working toward her degree. The couple never settled down, moving once a year due to complaints from landlords about the dogs and birds they kept. In 1986, Jeffrey became a police officer in Hoffman Estates. He was eventually dismissed, with police chief Donald Cundiff stating that Jeffrey "lacked common sense". His mother stated that Jeffrey disliked arresting people, as he felt he would be ruining someone's day.On January 9, 1990, Jeffrey robbed his first bank, the First Nationwide Bank branch in Wilmette. His modus operandi— brazenly entering the bank wearing a fake dark beard, baseball cap, sunglasses, and driving gloves, while carrying a police scanner and announcing a hold-up—would be repeated with the same military precision in most of the pair's subsequent robberies over the next two years. The disguise would later prompt bank employees to refer to Jeffrey as the "bearded bank robber". He wore clothing in layers in order to disguise his weight.  Jill's role is believed to have been setting up the getaway cars.On November 4, 1991, Palatine police officer Kevin Maher was following a Japanese-made car and noted it had an expired registration sticker. When Maher initiated a traffic stop, the driver of the car, wearing a fake beard and sunglasses, suddenly slammed on the brakes, jumped out, and opened fire on Maher with a rifle. Maher, still in his squad car, reversed from the scene and was shot in the shoulder. Rookie police dispatcher James Dunning, who was riding along with Maher, was uninjured. Federal agents created a special task force in the wake of this shooting. On November 18, a man wearing a fake beard robbed a First Chicago Bank branch in Elk Grove Village.

Townhouse, book store, and Jill's deterioration
In February 1991, the couple bought an $86,000 townhouse on Waterford Drive in Hanover Park, paying $22,600 in cash as a down payment. Jeffrey told the real estate agent that he was self-employed, and that for him money was no problem. The couple, who were considered loners, were nocturnal, setting out nightly at 3 a.m. on their loud Honda motorcycles. In May, Jeffrey opened a used book store in Roselle, Best Used Books. Customers were impressed with the excellent condition of the books and Jeffrey's knowledge of the classics.By wintertime, Jeffrey stated that Jill entered a hospital with an alcoholism problem, and was diagnosed with manic depression. Jeffrey's brother, Jim Erickson, stated that doctors found she was suffering from schizophrenia and had been prescribed Prozac.

Death of Jill Erickson
On December 10, authorities noticed a Mazda automobile, with its ignition wires exposed, at the edge of a parking lot. Noting that no robberies had occurred nearby, they decided to stake out the car. Six days later, just before noon, Jeffrey and Jill arrived at the parking lot in a grey van. It was believed that they had set out to rob their ninth bank. Jeffrey got out and entered the stolen car, and the officers promptly surrounded it. Authorities stated that Jeffrey was carrying two guns, a fake beard, and two false mustaches. Jeffrey, startled, twice tried to reach for his gun, which lay beside him on the seat, but was warned off. Meanwhile, police approached Jill in the van and she immediately sped off, with police in hot pursuit. The chase continued at high speeds for 11 miles (18 km) through Schaumburg, at times reaching 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), until Jill made a turn at 12:15 p.m. onto Bear Flag Drive, the entranceway to a contained residential development in Hanover Park. Finding herself cornered, she fired a hail of bullets at the officers, who fired back, striking her. She was found slumped on the seat with blood streaming from her head, and was pronounced dead at Humana Hospital in Hoffman Estates at around 6 p.m. The coroner stated that, while Jill was hit by police bullets, her death was caused by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Jeffrey was arrested in connection with at least eight bank robberies that netted $180,000. A search of the townhouse revealed 38 guns of different types and 25 boxes of ammunition, along with smoke grenades, gas masks, burglary tools, a police radio scanner, and $1,742 in cash. The garage featured an enormous safe, and a bulletproof vest had arrived at their mail drop.

Death of Jeffrey Erickson
On February 12, 1992, Jeffrey Erickson was indicted on federal charges connected to eight bank robberies, and state charges in regards to the shooting of officer Maher, to which he pleaded not guilty. On July 13, his trial began in the United States district court. Three days later, while Officer Maher testified that he could not positively identify Erickson as the shooter, federal prosecutors demonstrated that shell casings found at the scene matched a gun found in the Ericksons' townhouse.On July 20 shortly before 5:30 p.m., Erickson was being escorted from the courtroom in the Dirksen Federal Building to the Metropolitan Correctional Center by way of a basement area. He managed to free one of his hands from its handcuff, disarmed a deputy United States marshal, then fatally shot her partner, Roy "Bill" Frakes, twice in the back of the head with the gun. While trying to run away, in a shootout, Erickson was shot in the back four times by Chicago Police Department veteran detective Harry Belluomini. Erickson shot and killed Belluomini with a single gunshot wound in the chest. The wounded Erickson then ventured halfway up a ramp leading to the street but then stopped, shot and killed himself.

Legacy
The 1996 American crime drama film Normal Life drew inspiration from the Ericksons. Luke Perry played Chris, a rookie policeman who falls in love with the beautiful yet volatile Pam, played by Ashley Judd. The couple soon find themselves embarking on a life of crime characterized by bank robbery, which leads to their eventual self-destruction.  The Ericksons are also the subject of the 1997 television film, In the Line of Duty: Blaze of Glory, starring Bruce Campbell and Lori Loughlin, along with an episode of The FBI Files, titled "Death Pact" (Season 5, Episode 14).


Laissez-faire ( LESS-ay-FAIR; from French: laissez faire [lɛse fɛʁ] (listen), lit. 'let do') is an economic system in which transactions between private groups of people are free or almost free from any form of economic interventionism (such as regulation and subsidies) other than the enforcement of property laws. As a system of thought, laissez-faire rests on the following axioms: "the individual is the basic unit in society, i.e. the standard of measurement in social calculus; the individual has a natural right to freedom; and the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self-regulating system."Another basic principle of laissez-faire holds that markets should naturally be competitive, a rule that the early advocates of laissez-faire always emphasized. With the aims of maximizing freedom by allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of laissez-faire proposed a impôt unique, a tax on land rent (similar to Georgism) to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing production.Proponents of laissez-faire argue for a near complete separation of government from the economic sector. The phrase laissez-faire is part of a larger French phrase and literally translates to "let [it/them] do", but in this context the phrase usually means to "let it be" and in expression "laid back." Although never practiced with full consistency, laissez-faire capitalism emerged in the mid-18th century and was further popularized by Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations.While associated with capitalism in common usage, there are also non-capitalist forms of laissez-faire, including some forms of market socialism.

Etymology and usage
The term laissez-faire likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French Controller-General of Finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert and a group of French businessmen headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager mercantilist minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply: "Laissez-nous faire" ("Leave it to us" or "Let us do [it]", the French verb not requiring an object).The anecdote on the Colbert–Le Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the Journal économique, written by French minister and champion of free trade René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson—also the first known appearance of the term in print. Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst:

Laissez faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé [...]. Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins ! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du cœur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu ! Laissez faire !!Let go, which should be the motto of all public power, since the world was civilized [...]. [It is] a detestable principle of those that want to enlarge [themselves] but by the abasement of our neighbours. There is but the wicked and the malignant heart[s] [who are] satisfied by this principle and [its] interest is opposed. Let go, for God's sake! Let go!!
Vincent de Gournay, a French Physiocrat and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term laissez-faire as he allegedly adopted it from François Quesnay's writings on China. Quesnay coined the phrases laissez-faire and laissez-passer, laissez-faire being a translation of the Chinese term wu wei (無為). Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert–Le Gendre anecdote, he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: "Laissez faire et laissez passer" ("Let do and let pass"). His motto has also been identified as the longer "Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même !" ("Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.Before d'Argenson or Gournay, P. S. de Boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase "On laisse faire la nature" ("Let nature run its course"). D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto "Pas trop gouverner" ("Govern not too much").The Physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with Adam Smith, developed the idea. It is with the Physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated. The book Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State states: "The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a 'natural order' or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws".The French phrase laissez-faire gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. George Whatley's 1774 Principles of Trade (co-authored with Benjamin Franklin) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote; this may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.Herbert Spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of laissez faire—to "that miserable laissez-faire" that leads to men's ruin, saying: "Along with that miserable laissez-faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!"As a product of the Enlightenment, laissez-faire was "conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government". In a similar vein, Adam Smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law. By extension, free markets become a reflection of the natural system of liberty. For Smith, laissez-faire was "a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth".However, Smith and notable classical economists such as Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo did not use the phrase. Jeremy Bentham used the term, but it was probably James Mill's reference to the laissez-faire maxim (together with the "Pas trop gouverner" motto) in an 1824 entry for the Encyclopædia Britannica that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the Anti-Corn Law League (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning.Smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest. Although not the metaphor itself, the idea lying behind the invisible hand belongs to Bernard de Mandeville and his Fable of the Bees (1705). In political economy, that idea and the doctrine of laissez-faire have long been closely related. Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for laissez-faire, although Smith never actually used the term himself. In Third Millennium Capitalism (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers Jr. notes a trend whereby recently "conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term 'free-market capitalism' in lieu of laissez-faire".American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire socialists and political individualists while arguing that their "anarchistic socialism" or "individual anarchism" was "consistent Manchesterism".

History
Europe
In Europe, the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the Physiocrats, a movement that included Vincent de Gournay (1712–1759), a successful merchant turned political figure. Gournay is postulated to have adapted the Taoist concept wu wei, from the writings on China by François Quesnay (1694–1774). Gournay held that government should allow the laws of nature to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. François Quesnay and Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l'Aulne took up Gournay's ideas. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, Louis XV and in 1754 persuaded him to give laissez-faire a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain. For more than a decade, the experiment appeared successful, but 1768 saw a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the Comptroller-General of Finances Joseph Marie Terray revoked the edict allowing free trade in grain.The doctrine of laissez-faire became an integral part of 19th-century European liberalism. Just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics, seeing the state as merely a passive policeman, protecting private property and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen, British industrialists in particular, were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests. Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in Sweden, Tuscany, Spain and in the newly created United States. Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations (1776), met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.In Britain, the newspaper The Economist (founded in 1843) became an influential voice for laissez-faire capitalism. Laissez-faire advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the British Empire. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in Ireland, founder of The Economist James Wilson wrote: "It is no man's business to provide for another". More specifically, in An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus argued that there was nothing that could be done to avoid famines because he felt he had mathematically proven that population growth tends to exceed growth in food production. However, The Economist campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed. However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.A group that became known as the Manchester Liberals, to which Richard Cobden (1804–1865) and John Bright (1811–1889) belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade. After the death of Cobden, the Cobden Club (founded in 1866) continued their work. In 1860, Britain and France concluded a trade treaty, after which other European countries signed several similar treaties. The breakdown of laissez-faire as practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies.

United States
Frank Bourgin's study of the Constitutional Convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founding Fathers. The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the Articles of Confederation. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. Others view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter Ronald Reagan's economic policies.Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the United States had distinctive characteristics and that "at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of laissez-faire. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, laissez-faire did not mean "no government intervention" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers". Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the American Civil War include the establishment of the Patent Office in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the tariff of 1828). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President George Washington in the absence of an agreement that was reached between Alexander Hamilton and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the District of Columbia. In contrast to Hamilton and the Federalists was Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's opposing political party, the Democratic-Republicans.
Most of the early opponents of laissez-faire capitalism in the United States subscribed to the American School. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a government-sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding protectionist influence in the antebellum period came from Henry Clay and his American System. In the early 19th century, "it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an inappropriate one" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry. In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the Whig tradition of economic nationalism, which included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure. Public works such as the provision and regulation transportation such as railroads took effect. The Pacific Railway Acts provided the development of the First Transcontinental Railroad. In order to help pay for its war effort in the Civil War, the United States government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 August 1861 as part of the Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US$800; rescinded in 1872).
Following the Civil War, the movement towards a mixed economy accelerated. Protectionism increased with the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and the Dingley Tariff of 1897. Government regulation of the economy expanded with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman Anti-trust Act. The Progressive Era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the Woodrow Wilson administration's New Freedom program. Following World War I and the Great Depression, the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive income tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by "voluntary" export restrictions from Japan.In 1986, Pietro S. Nivola wrote: "By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies – that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic".A more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been Objectivist Ayn Rand, who described it as "the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State". This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation, which is a theory stating that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare. Rand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights) and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, socialism and dictatorship. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.

Models
Capitalism
A closely related conception is that of raw or pure capitalism, or unrestrained capitalism, that refers to capitalism free of social regulations, with low, minimal or no government and operating almost entirely on the profit motive. Other than laissez-faire economics and anarcho-capitalism, it is not associated with a school of thought. It typically has a bad connotation, which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit.
Robert Kuttner states that "for over a century, popular struggles in democracies have used the nation-state to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance".The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, durability, sustainability, respect for the environment and human beings as well as a lack of morality. From this more critical angle, companies might naturally aim to maximise profits at the expense of workers' and broader social interests.Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism argue that it relies on a constitutionally limited government that unconditionally bans the initiation of force and coercion, including fraud. Therefore, free market economists such as Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell argue that, under such a system, relationships between companies and workers are purely voluntary and mistreated workers will seek better treatment elsewhere. Thus, most companies will compete for workers on the basis of pay, benefits, and work-life balance just as they compete with one another in the marketplace on the basis of the relative cost and quality of their goods.So-called "raw" or "hyper-capitalism" is a prime motive of cyberpunk in dystopian works such as Syndicate.

Socialism
Although laissez-faire has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar laissez-faire economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing laissez-faire, or free-market anarchism, also known as free-market anti-capitalism and free-market socialism to distinguish it from laissez-faire capitalism. One first example of this is mutualism as developed by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in the 18th century, from which emerged individualist anarchism. Benjamin Tucker is one eminent American individualist anarchist who adopted a laissez-faire system he termed anarchistic socialism in contraposition to state socialism. This tradition has been recently associated with contemporary scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles W. Johnson, Brad Spangler, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Gary Chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these left-libertarians believe to be riddled with capitalist and statist privileges. Referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical and pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race. Critics of laissez-faire as commonly understood argues that a truly laissez-faire system would be anti-capitalist and socialist.Kevin Carson describes his politics as on "the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism" and has also been highly critical of intellectual property. Carson has identified the work of Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, Ralph Borsodi, Paul Goodman, Lewis Mumford, Elinor Ostrom, Peter Kropotkin and Ivan Illich as sources of inspiration for his approach to politics and economics. In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), he argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. Carson believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas he also focuses on organizational issues. As such, the primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies. The theoretical sections of Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy are also presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value.In response to claims that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to "make a point". He claims that "the term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf". Carson holds that "capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable". Carson argues that in a truly laissez-faire system the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible. Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase vulgar political economy which Karl Marx described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]".Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume. This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern. He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity, defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.Chartier has discussed natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers. He objects on natural law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally and develops a general natural law account of boycotts. He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, "it makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose 'capitalism.' Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement's radical roots, emphasizes the value of understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object to non-aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers — as well as ordinary people around the world who use "capitalism" as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives".

Criticism
Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of laissez-faire economics. Adam Smith acknowledges some moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism. Smith had misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society, namely the landlords, the workers and the capitalists. Smith claimed that "[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests" and that "[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords". According to Smith, the landlords should be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations, but they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness.Many philosophers have written on the systems society has created to manage their civilizations.  Thomas Hobbes utilized the concept of a "state of nature," which is a time before any government or laws, as a starting point to consider the question.  In this time, life would be "war of all against all."  Further, "In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain . . . continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."  Smith was quite clear that he believed that without morality and laws, society would fail.  From that perspective, it would be strange for Smith to support a pure Laissez-Faire style of capitalism, and what he does support in Wealth of Nations is heavily dependent on the moral philosophy from his previous work, Theory of Moral Sentiments.Regardless of preferred political preference, all societies require shared moral values as a prerequisite on which to build laws to protect individuals from each other. Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations during the Enlightenment, a period of time when the prevailing attitude was,  "All things can be Known."  In effect, European thinkers, inspired by the likes of Isaac Newton and others,  set about to "find the laws" of all things, that there existed a "natural law" underlying all aspects of life. They believed that these could be discovered and that everything in the universe could be rationally demystified and cataloged, including human interactions.Critics and market abolitionists such as David McNally argue in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that Smith's moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed. According to McNally, the development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance.The British economist John Maynard Keynes condemned laissez-faire economic policy on several occasions. In The End of Laissez-faire (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of laissez-faire are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.The Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek stated that a freely competitive, laissez-faire banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, arguing that the need for central banking control was inescapable.Karl Polanyi's Great Transformation criticizes self-regulating markets as aberrational, unnatural phenomena which tend towards social disruption.

Kalingga (Javanese: Karajan Kalingga; 訶陵 Hēlíng or 闍婆 Dūpó in Chinese sources) was a 6th-century Indianized kingdom on the north coast of Central Java, Indonesia. It was the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in Central Java, and together with Kutai and Tarumanagara are the oldest kingdoms in Indonesian history.

Historiography
The archaeological findings and historical records from this period are scarce, and the exact location of kingdom's capital is unknown. It is thought to be somewhere between present-day Pekalongan or Jepara. A place named Keling subdistrict is found in northern coast of Jepara Regency, however some archaeological findings near Pekalongan and Batang regency shows that Pekalongan was an ancient port, suggests that Pekalongan might be an altered name of Pe-Kaling-an. Kalingga existed between the 6th and 7th centuries, and it was one of the earliest Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms established in Java. The historical record of this kingdom is scarce and vague, and comes mostly from Chinese sources and local traditions.
Kalingga appeared in the 5th century which is thought to be located in the north of Central Java . Information about the Kalingga Kingdom is obtained from inscriptions and records from China . In 752, the Kalingga Kingdom became Sriwijaya's conquered territory because this kingdom was part of a trading network, along with the Dharmasraya and Tarumanagara Kingdoms which Srivijaya had previously conquered . The three kingdoms became strong competitors of the Srivijaya - Buddhist trading network .

History
The Chinese sources come from China and date back to the Tang Dynasty. According to the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing, in 664 a Chinese Buddhist monk named Huining (會寧 Huìníng) had arrived in Heling and stayed there for about three years. During his stay, and with the assistance of Jnanabhadra, a Heling monk, he translated numerous Buddhist Hinayana scriptures.: 79 In 674 the kingdom was ruled by Queen Shima, notorious for her fierce law against thievery, which encouraged her people to be honest and uphold absolute truth. According to tradition, one day a foreign king placed a bag filled with gold on the intersection in Kalingga to test the famed truthful and honesty of Kalingga people. Nobody dared to touch the bag that did not belong to them, until three years later when Shima's son, the crown prince, accidentally touched the bag with his foot. The queen issued a death sentence to her own son, but was over-ruled by a minister that appealed the queen to spare the prince's life. Since it was the prince's foot that touched the bag of gold, so it was the foot that must be punished through mutilation. According to Carita Parahyangan, a book composed in later period, Shima's great-grandson is Sanjaya, who is the king of Sunda Kingdom and Galuh Kingdom, and also the founder of Mataram Kingdom.
Between 742 and 755, the kingdom had moved further east from the Dieng Plateau, perhaps in response to the Buddhist Sailendras.: 90

The Tukmas inscription was estimated to be originated from Kalingga period. It was discovered on the western slope of Mount Merapi, at Dusun Dakawu, Lebak village, Kecamatan Grabag, Magelang Regency, Central Java, and is written in Pallava script in Sanskrit tells about a clear spring water that is so sacred that adored as the analogue of holy Ganges's source in India. The inscription also bears Hindu signs and imageries, such as trisula, kamandalu (water jar), parashu (axe), kalacengkha (shell), chakra and padma (red lotus), those are symbols of Hindu gods.Another inscription dated from around the same period is Sojomerto inscription, discovered in Sojomerto village, Kecamatan Reban, Batang Regency, Central Java. It is written in Kavi script in Old Malay language, estimated dated from 7th century. The inscription tell about a ruler named Dapunta Selendra, son of Santanu and Bhadrawati, and husband of Sampula. Indonesian historian Prof. Drs. Boechari suggested that Dapunta Selendra was the ancestor of Sailendras that later rule in Mataram Kingdom.
Both inscriptions suggest that c. 7th century on the northern coast of Central Java, once flourish a Hindu Shivaist kingdom, today identified as Kalingga kingdom. Some oldest Javanese candis are also can be found in mountainous surrounding areas on northern Central Java, such as the Hindu temples of Dieng Plateau, and Gedong Songo temples, but they are probably built in later period, during the early Mataram Kingdom. Historian suggested that there was a link between this old kingdom with later kingdom flourish in Southern Central Java Kedu Plain, the Sailendra of Mataram Kingdom.

The district was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.The area, though small (consisting of only sixteen total properties), is significant in terms of offering perspectives on the development of Aiken. In the district it is possible to experience Aiken's antebellum origins, its winter resort era, and finally its maturation as a year-round community. The buildings, many of which were constructed between 1900 and 1930, are protected from view by trees and shrubs, but nevertheless, the district can be enjoyed from a car.


Christofer J. Clemente is an Australian scientist specialising in biomechanics. He is a Research Fellow in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland and in 2011 was awarded a grant of A$375,000 for "Design of a biologically inspired running and climbing robotic lizard" by the Australian Research Council.He has a B.Sc. (2000) and Ph.D. (2006) from the University of Western Australia, his doctoral thesis being on "Evolution of Locomotion in Australian Varanid lizards (Reptilia: Squamata: Varanidae): Ecomorphological and ecophysiological considerations". He has held post-doctoral positions at Cambridge (2007-2009) and Harvard (2010-2012).In October 2013 he appeared on BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity. His hypothetical donation to this fictional museum was "a lizard popping a wheelie": he explained that when a dragon lizard reaches a certain running speed its front legs lift off the ground because they cannot match the speed of the back legs, so it acquires a bipedal gait, analogous to a bicycle's wheelie.

The MU90 Impact is an advanced lightweight anti-submarine torpedo of the 3rd generation developed by France and Italy for navies of France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Australia and Poland. It is designed to compete with and outperform the United States-built Mark 54 in the anti-submarine role, and has also been developed in a special MU90 Hard Kill version for torpedo anti-torpedo defence.  The MU90 is built by EuroTorp, a consortium of French and Italian companies.

History
The MU90 was the result of separate projects in France and Italy from the 1980s. In France, a project under the direction of Thomson Sintra created the "Murène" in 1989, while in Italy Whitehead started work on an A244 replacement known as the A290. In 1990 the first attempts to merge the two efforts started, a process that was completed in 1993 with the formation of EuroTorp.The French intended to use the new torpedo on their frigates, Atlantique 2 aircraft, Lynx helicopters and NFH90 helicopters.  They originally wanted 1000 units, but the end of the Cold War saw their requirement cut to 600 in 1991, 450 in 2000 and finally 300 torpedoes in 2008. The project has cost France €1,150m in 2012 prices at a unit cost of €1.6m, or €3.8m including development costs. 25 torpedoes per year were to be delivered to France until 2014.

Design
The MU90 is designed to be capable of discriminating between actual and perceived threat, including a bottomed stationary mini-submarine, known versions of anechoic coatings, and various decoys.  It is also capable of launch speeds up to 400 knots (740 km/h; 460 mph), allowing it to be dropped from maritime patrol aircraft flying at high speeds, or rocket-assist launchers. Powered by an electric pump-jet, it can be run at "silent" speeds to avoid giving its location away to the submarine, or "dash" at speeds over 29 knots. It uses a shaped charge warhead that can penetrate any known submarine hull, in particular Soviet double hull designs, while remaining just as deadly in shallow waters where conventional warheads are less effective.
In 1986 France and Italy began a collaboration to develop an anti-submarine missile based on the Italian Otomat missile. France dropped out of the programme but Italy has fitted the MBDA MILAS missile to its  Durand de la Penne-class destroyers and FREMM anti-submarine frigates. MILAS is an 800 kg (1,800 lb) missile that can deliver a MU90 to 35 kilometres (19 nmi).

Exports
After deciding that its Mark 46 torpedoes were inadequate, Australia set up the JP2070 project in 1998 to buy torpedoes for its  Adelaide-class frigates,  Anzac-class frigates, AP-3C Orion aircraft, S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopters and planned SH-2G(A) Super Seasprite helicopters. The Seasprites were cancelled and the Orions and Seahawks were removed from the MU90 programme on budget grounds; their replacements, the P-8 Poseidon and MH-60R Seahawk will use the US Mark 54 torpedo. The A$639m project to buy a classified number of MU90 has been heavily criticised by the Australian National Audit Office on the grounds of cost, insufficient test firings which failed to reveal defects in the torpedo, and the lack of commonality with the Navy's air-launched torpedoes. The MU90 reached IOC in November 2012.

Book of Intuition is a studio album by jazz pianist Kenny Barron with bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Johnathan Blake. The album was released on March 4, 2016, via Impulse! Records label.

Background
The album contains 10 tracks, of which seven are Barron's original compositions written in a period of time. Two pieces, "In the Slow Lane" and "Prayer", were featured in the soundtrack for 2010 film Another Harvest Moon. Book of Intuition is Barron's first trio album in 20 some years—since Wanton Spirit with Charlie Haden and Roy Haynes. Barron has performed onstage with Kitagawa and Blake for 20 and 10 years, respectively, yet he had never recorded an album with his long-time trio until this album.The album earned the trio a Grammy Award nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.

Reception
John Fordham of The Guardian noted: "Barron has absorbed an encyclopaedia of jazz methods from a life on the road with legends such as Ella Fitzgerald and Stan Getz, and it pours out in these tracks. Magic Dance, with its glistening chords and Latin-jazz tick, sounds smooth at first but unleashes an impulsive torrent. Ballads such as In the Slow Lane display his impeccably light touch and Thelonious Monk’s Shuffle Boil isn’t Monkishly lateral but swings furiously. The jangling Lunacy is a collective bustle prodded by bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Johnathan Blake, while Nightfall is delicate drift through slow chords. There might be too many notes for some on this record, but it’s almost all affectingly musical just the same". Dave Gelly in his review for The Observer wrote, "It has everything – attractive melody, unbuttoned swing, virtuosity and enough rhythmic sleight-of-hand to keep you wide awake. Among the dozen or so most admired pianists in jazz today, Kenny Barron strikes me as the one who wears his mastery most comfortably."Cormak Larkin of The Irish Times wrote: "Barron’s latest trio, with the impeccable rhythm team of bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Jonathan Blake, is as assured and authoritative as you would expect, here emphasising the Latin side of the trio tradition with a deeply grooving set of originals (and a couple of Monk tunes) that sparkle like cut glass". Fred Kaplan writing for Stereophile commented, "The session ... has a warm, crisp sound with plenty of air and thump, though the drums are a little bit two-dimensional." Mac Randal of JazzTimes wrote, "For some strange reason, the trio that Kenny Barron has been leading for the past decade, featuring bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and drummer Johnathan Blake, had never cut an album until now. We should all thank the deity of our choice that they finally entered a recording studio, because Book of Intuition is a total delight."

WMBB, virtual and VHF digital channel 13, is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Panama City, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group. WMBB's studios are located on Harrison Avenue/US 231 in downtown Panama City, and its transmitter is located in unincorporated Youngstown along the Bay–Calhoun county line.

History
It first began broadcast operations on October 4, 1973 as WDTB started by Panhandle Broadcasting Corporation (run by attorney Denver T. Brannen, from where the original call letters were derived from), financed by local businessman/car dealer Tommy Thomas, and attorneys Julian Bennett and Dick Arnold. When it first took to the air, the station was originally an NBC affiliate. The station was a relatively late start for a VHF frequency; most of the allocations on that band elsewhere in the U.S. had been taken by that point. On February 28, 1977, WDTB was sold to Octagon Broadcasting, an Atlanta-based outfit. Upon the change, Octagon changed the station's call sign to the current WMBB (which stands for "The World's Most Beautiful Beaches").
Originally, the station was positioned to be the NBC affiliate for Tallahassee as well since the market did not have one until April 21, 1983, when WTWC-TV signed on. At the time, WMBB's transmitter was in Frink, Calhoun County, well over fifty miles (80 km) away from Tallahassee at approximately 30°22′9″N 85°12′29″W. In addition, many viewers in the capital city already received NBC from Albany, Georgia's WALB which provided a better signal to the area.
On January 4, 1982, WMBB became an ABC affiliate, swapping affiliations with crosstown rival WJHG, which had been the market's original NBC station prior to 1972. Then on December 5, 1986, Buford Television of Tyler, Texas purchased the station and began investing in equipment and news talent in order to make the station more competitive, not only with WJHG, but also with Dothan, Alabama's WTVY, the CBS station serving the eastern part of the northwestern Florida Panhandle region. It was also around this time that this station moved from its location in Downtown Panama City to its current location on Harrison Avenue that formerly housed a Buick dealership. The new facilities offered three times the space of the previous location.
Unexpectedly at 2:03 p.m. Central Time on May 18, 1989, an Air Force F-15 fighter jet clipped a wire at WMBB's Frink tower. This caused the tower, antenna, and transmitter to be completely destroyed. Not long after this incident, channel 13 was sold once again. This time, it joined Spartan Communications of Spartanburg, South Carolina as the construction of new transmission equipment got underway. The company completed the acquisition on April 12, 1990. On August 6 of that same year, WMBB began broadcasting from a new 1,500-foot (457 m) state-of-the-art antenna and transmitter tower now in Youngstown. This allowed for better viewing of the station in the western half of the market including the rapidly growing southern Walton County area and Destin.
In 1993, WMBB became one of several ABC affiliates across the country that refused clearance to the ABC show NYPD Blue. Instead, it aired syndicated programming during the timeslot. Then-general manager Hugh Roche kept the show off the station until 1997 when the parental rating system was adopted by the networks. By the time WMBB finally allowed the program to air, it was the last station in the country to lift its ban on the show.
In March 2000, this station became one of 13 in a package acquired by Media General worth $605 million. Later that year, Media General purchased the Jackson County Floridan newspaper. WMBB then established a Jackson County Bureau and used the resources of the Floridan to cover Jackson County as well. This caught the eye of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) because of the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market. With the sale of WMBB to Hoak Media, the issue became moot. By the time Media General sold the station, Media General was granted a permanent waiver by the FCC to operate both properties in the same market. Media General later divested all of their newspapers (with the exception of the Tampa Tribune) to Warren Buffett's World Media Holdings in June 2012.
On March 14, 2008, it was announced that Media General would sell the station (and then-sister KALB-TV in Alexandria, Louisiana) to Hoak Media. The deal was closed on July 16. At the time of the closing, WMBB was Hoak's only television station east of the Mississippi River. In July 2010, the station replaced its second digital subchannel broadcast of weather radar with This TV. That network originally aired on WBIF after that channel stopped airing content from the Retro Television Network (RTV). Its replacement was supposed to be WPGX-DT2 but this never made it to air.
On November 20, 2013, Hoak announced the sale of most of its stations, including WMBB, to Gray Television. Due to Gray's existing ownership of WJHG-TV and WECP-LD, Gray immediately placed the station, along with KREX-TV in Grand Junction, Colorado, up for sale to comply with FCC regulations. On December 19, Gray announced that the overlap properties, including WMBB, would be sold to Nexstar Broadcasting Group, for $37.5 million. The sale was completed on June 13, 2014. The deal made WMBB a sister station to Dothan's ABC affiliate, WDHN. On January 17, 2017, Nexstar completed its purchase of Media General, which reunited WMBB with most of its former Media General sister stations.
The station was knocked off the air on October 10, 2018 by Hurricane Michael.

Digital television
Digital channels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

Analog-to-digital conversion
WMBB shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 19 to VHF channel 13.

News operation
WMBB made history during Hurricane Dennis in July 2005 when it became the first station in Panama City to broadcast live storm coverage over the internet. It was one of the first stations in the country to use Weather Services International's Titan forecasting tool (a 3D forecasting system which showed the collapse of the storm just before it struck Santa Rosa Island).
On July 21, 2011, WMBB announced on their Facebook page that they would add another newscast starting September 12, News 13 Midday, that will run from 11 a.m. until noon each day. This is actually a return to doing a news program during the midday time slot since the station used to produce a midday program until the late-1990s.
In February 2016, Tom Lewis returned to WMBB to become their news director.  He was the primary anchor from the late 1980s until 2001, and left for rival station WJHG to become their primary anchor until 2014. He also served as their news director from 2005 to 2010.
On June 1, 2020, WMBB began producing an hour-long 9 p.m. weeknight newscast for Fox affiliate WPGX.

Black Starlet is a 1974 film.

Plot summary
Introduction
A young woman decides she no longer wants to work as a street walker in Chicago, now she wants to follow her dreams as an actress in Hollywood. The main cast members are Clara/Carla Brown – Juanita Brown, Brisco – Eric Mason, Ben – Rockne Tarkington, Skully – Damu King, Joyce – Diane Holden, Phil – Noah Keen, and Sam – Al Lewis. The writers are Daniel Cady and Howard Ostroff. The movie was filmed in Hollywood.

Plot
The protagonist, Clara, starts out as a prostitute but is a young aspiring actress at heart. After saving up some money, she leavesher pimp boyfriend behind and moves to Hollywood. After some initial struggles, being robbed and pursued by lustful men, she finally makes it to Hollywood. While looking for work, Clara met a good friend named Joyce. Joyce taught Clara all the ins and outs about Hollywood, even introducing her to her manager. Although during Clara's time as an actress she was raped, Clara did not let that stop her. She soon became a well-known actress/writer.

Background
One of the reasons this movie wasn't your typical 1970s person top pick is that it was a low-budget movie, according to the "Every 70s Movie" article. Since the movie was set at a low budget this meant that the actors and actresses wouldn't be too great. As stated in the "Every 70s Movie" article, "Yet Black Starlet meets and nearly exceeds the very low expectations set by its subject matter and title." Everyone in that time period just knew it was going to be a terrible movie because no one wanted to give up more funds for it forcing the producers to find casts willing to work for a very low wage. According to "Every 70s Movie", "What makes Black Starlet more or less palatable are the moments wedged between exploitation-flick extremes."

Social norms
In the 1970s, it was a time when everyone was fighting for equality, African Americans, women, gays, and lesbians. The book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom stated that during the 1970s "Very few films attempted to explore a black woman's tensions or aspirations or to examine the dynamics of sexual politics within the black community." Women were and still are experiencing sexual abuse. To further the fight for equality even if the industry felt no one would be interested in hearing about a black woman's struggle. Women were constantly put down about their acting talent but that was all put to rest when the movie Sparkle was introduced. It too was a low budget film that everyone thought would not take off anywhere, but soon became an appealing movie.

Womanism
The fight for women's rights: the 1970s was a time when women were campaigning women's rights. In 1972, Congress approved the Equal Rights Amendment. This amendment states “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” This was a time where women opened abortion clinics and rape centers. According to the book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom, "It was the 1970s, that slick trendy, and contradictory era that led opened with politics and social issues very much on the minds of most Americans." The 1970s was an era for Black women to show that they were more than just a stereotype, they could act as well. In the book it discusses, "What with the Black Nationalist movement, the youth movement, and the rising tide of feminism, the 1970s looked as if it, like the 1960s, would be propelled along by political activism. The movies gave Blacks a way to express their feelings without backlash. With this being said the 1970s era was different, different how? Bucks and a Black Movie Boom states that "Then, too, while the 1970s opened with films with some political heat, the age closed with movies that were increasingly more escapist." In this era, Blacks were looking for a movie that shed light to America's racial conflicts and issues such as actors who showed power, who showed they weren't afraid of standing up for what was right. The 1970s is explained to be, "No other period in black movie history, however, has been quite so energetic or important as the frenetic 1970s," as described in the book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom. This era, was like no other time era. It was a moment for anyone, blacks included, to rise above the pre-existing weak stereotypes.

Discussion of context
The soundtrack to the movie is soulful music coming from Joe Hinton and Dee Irvin. Songs include “Up is Down”, “Hollywood Faces”, “Fire Sign”, and “Go on and Find Your Star”.

Conclusion
As far as information about the main characters, there is not much information about Juanita Brown and Rockne Tarkington died in 2015. It is said that Tarkington has appeared in many movies. As for Brown, she has appeared in a few movies as stated in the article "Every 70s Movie". Yet nothing else has appeared about the actress. This film is listed as a blaxploitation film on Wikipedia.

Heaton Park BT Tower is a 238 foot (72.54 metres) tall telecommunication tower built of reinforced concrete close to the banks of Heaton Park Reservoir, at Heaton Park, Manchester, England. Heaton Park BT Tower is one of the few British towers built of reinforced concrete, and one of seven BT towers of the 'Chilterns' design.
Source: Ben Collins: 1980s folklore originating from the Dumers Lane area of Radcliffe, M26 suggest that the tower was often referred to as “The Scullion” amongst local children seeking adventure / mischief. 
During the Cold War, the British government proposed a communications network that (it was hoped) would survive a nuclear attack. Radio stations (including the Heaton Park Tower) would maintain national and international communications before, during and after a nuclear emergency, transmitting microwave radio signals in a network known as Backbone. Spurs feeding into the network were provided at three locations: London, Manchester (Heaton Park Tower) and Birmingham. Whether the plan for the Backbone network was realised is information protected by the Official Secrets Act 1911 but, during the planning process, HM Government denied in Parliament that there was anything secretive about the tower or its function.Beside the tower was a monitoring station (one of hundreds across the country) to record the blast and fallout in the event of a nuclear war. The station provided for three men from the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) to live underground whilst recording what was happening above ground in the event of a nuclear strike.
